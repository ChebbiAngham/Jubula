					<li class="list">You can now use <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/">Mylyn</a> 
					in GUI<i>dancer</i> to manage tasks and contexts. This makes working with 
					larger projects more comfortable.</li>
					<li class="list">You can create central test data sets and reuse them
					in your Test Cases to avoid having to write the same data more than once.</li>
					<li class="list">GUI<i>dancer</i> has a new search function, which lets
					you search for keywords and test data throughout the whole project. 
					From the Search Result View, you can easily spring to each search result
					to view or edit it.</li>
					<li class="list">We have introduced Manual Test Steps which can 
					be defined and executed manually, so that all your tests are in one GUI<i>dancer</i>
					project.</li>
					<li class="list">GUI<i>dancer</i> can now test applications that were 
					started by other applications in the test.</li>
					<li class="list">Test results from the Test Result Summary View can be 
					exported as HTML and XML reports.</li>
					<li class="list">We have some new actions (check existence of window, 
					store value on tree node and table cell).</li>
					<li class="list">We've added a new view to the Object Mapping Editor. This Split View
					provides a better overview and finer control of your Object Mapping.</li>
