			The following terms will be useful for understanding how to work with GUI<i>dancer</i>:
			</p>
			
			<ol>
			<li class="list"><b>Projects</b> are containers for your Test Cases and Test Suites. 
			They also contain information about your application under test, including
			how and where to start it. 
			<br>
			Projects are stored in a database, and can also be exported and imported in
			XML format.
			</li>
			
			<li class="list"><b>Test Suites</b> are the executable elements in GUI<i>dancer</i>. 
			Fill your Test Suites with the Test Cases you want to execute. 
			<br>
			Test Suites are bound to an application under test. 
			</li>
			
			<li class="list"><b>Test Cases</b> are the building blocks (keywords) for your tests. 
			They can contain Test Steps and other Test Cases. 
			<br>
			Combine Test Cases to create larger, more complex Test Cases. 
			</li>
		
			<li class="list"><b>Test Steps</b> are the smallest units in GUI<i>dancer</i>. 
			Each Test Step contains three pieces of information:
			<br>
			<ol>
			<li class="list">The component to be tested in the interface</li>
			<li class="list">The action to execute on the component</li>
			<li class="list">The data (or parameters) for the action</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			You also enter a <i>component name</i>, which is your own name for this 
			interface component. This name is joined to the real component name in the 
			application under test later.  
			</li>
			<li class="list">Most of the time, you will not be working with Test Steps, but with 
			the GUI<i>dancer</i> library of unbound modules, which contains ready made Test Cases to reference in
			your tests. Each unbound module represents one Test Step to carry out a particular action. The library 
			makes test creation easier by allowing you to drag and drop modules to create your Test Cases. 
			</li>
			</ol>
