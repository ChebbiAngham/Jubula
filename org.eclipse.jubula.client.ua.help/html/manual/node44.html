    <p><a name="415"></a> <a name="416"></a> If the ITE and AUT Agent are installed on one machine, there are a few things to be aware of:<ul>
      <li>Don&#39;t use the mouse or any keyboard shortcuts during execution. The AUT takes control of the machine it is running on during test execution.<li>Make sure that the AUT is visible during test execution: <ul>
          <li>The ITE is minimized by default when test execution begins. Make sure that the AUT is the next window to receive focus when the ITE is minimized.<li>You can change the preference to minimize the ITE via:<br />
            <table border="0" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">
              <tr>
                <td bgcolor="#DDDDDD">Window</td>
                <td>--&gt;</td>
                <td bgcolor="#DDDDDD">Preferences</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <br /> If you do this, make sure that the AUT can also be seen on the screen when test execution begins.</ul>
    </ul>
