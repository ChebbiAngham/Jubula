      <li>You can activate the Chronon recording in Jubula by selecting: <br />
        <table border="0" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">

            <td><b>Linux users: you must first comment Chronon in for the ITE in the .ini file by removing the hash signs from the two lines in the .ini file, and then restart Jubula . If you are starting Jubula from the command line with Chronon on Linux, please ensure that your current directory is the Jubula directory, otherwise Jubula will not start.</b></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      <li>The Progress View will open and you will see the status of the recording. The progress bar continues to run once the recorder has started. The status changes from <i>starting</i> to <i>running</i>. When the recorder is running, you will be able to see the job running in the Progress View and also in the status bar. Do not stop the job - this will stop the recording. <li>Once the recorder is running, your actions in Jubula are written to the recording file. <table>
          <tr>
            <td><img align="BOTTOM" alt="\includegraphics[height=2cm]{lightbulb}" border="0" height="91" src="img2.jpg" width="100" /></td>

          <td><b>We do not recommend running the Chronon recorder constantly, as the collection of additional information can lead to detractions in performance in Jubula . Instead, we would recommend turning Chronon on when you specifically want to reproduce a problem, and turning it off afterwards. Additionally, you should ensure that you have increased the heap space to avoid running into memory problems.</b></td>
