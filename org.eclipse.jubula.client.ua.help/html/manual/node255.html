This Test Case is then also reused in one place - again alone which is then reused in one place alone in another Test Case and so on. Such hierarchies can often be redundant: the Test Case at the bottom of the hierarchy could just as well have been reused directly in the Test Case at the top of the hierarchy. <p> Such empty chains are collected during the analysis (which may take longer on larger Projects ) and displayed in the Search Result View. They are shown in order of their length, starting with the longest chains. <p> The analyses and metrics can either be run for the whole Project , or for specific contexts within the Project . <p> To run a metric or analysis for the whole Project , select the metric or analysis you want to perform from the toolbar button. <p> To run a metric or analysis for a specific context, select the context you require (e.g. the top node in the Test Case Browser to perform the metric or analysis just for items within this browser) and then select: <br />
      <table border="0" style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">
        <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#DDDDDD">Analyze</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br /> from the context menu, selecting the required option to run. <p> Once a metric or analysis has run, the results are shown in the Search Result View. <p>
