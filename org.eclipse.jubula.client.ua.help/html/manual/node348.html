Instead of vague or ambiguous names (e.g. Select), try and write names that describe the Test Case in terms of the action and the component it deals with. A few good examples are: <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Close Search Dialog with OK Button <li>Select Project Language from Combo Box <li>Fill in Project Wizard, containing: <ul>
            <li>Enter Project Name in Wizard <li>Select Project Language from List <li>Select Default Language from Combo Box <li>Close Project Wizard with Finish Button </ul>
      </ul>
    <p> The Test Case names do not have to exhaustively describe the component, or where it is in the AUT - using categories for the different areas of your AUT saves you having to do this <a href="node353.html#BPCategories">5.3.1</a>. The aim with naming your Test Cases is to make your tests readable and easy to understand. <p> You do not have to write Test Case names in CamelCase or with underscores - Test Case names are not used in the test executor, so there is no problem if they have spaces in them. <p>
