    <h3><a id="SECTION00611200000000000000" name="SECTION00611200000000000000"><span class="arabic">5</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span>.<span class="arabic">1</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span> The size of keywords</a></h3> Most keywords are likely to be reasonably small, because they are easier to combine and read when they are smaller. Also, it is easier to reuse smaller, less specific modules than larger ones. However, sometimes it can be worth making larger modules, especially for filling in tables, tabbed panes and dialogs. If you have to fill in the search dialog quite often, you could make a keyword containing all the necessary sub-keywords to fill in this dialog. You can parameterize the data that will change and maybe even enter default values that can be overwritten when the Test Case is reused. <p>
