The test run can be either via the ITE or via the command line <i>testexec</i>. <p>

          <td><b>If you run a test via the ITE which should report to ALM systems, the reporting is triggered automatically once the test has run. If the reporting for the test run encounters an error, then you will be able to manually trigger the reporting later <a href="#TasksALMReportTestExec">3.27.4.3</a>.

    <p> When reporting is triggered, the following happens: <ul>
        <li>A connection is made to ALM system configured in the Project properties. <li>The test results are then analyzed to see if any comments need to be added in the external repository (commenting can be (de)activated for failed nodes or successful nodes in the Project properties, for example). <li>If there are comments to be added, the ITE writes one comment per task, as defined in the Project properties. If multiple items in one test run reference the same task ID, or if an item with a task ID is executed multiple times in the same test run, then each test status and result link is written, but all in one comment. <table>
            <tr>
              <td><img align="BOTTOM" alt="\includegraphics[height=2cm]{lightbulb}" border="0" height="91" src="img2.jpg" width="100" /></td>
              <td><b>Tests that have a status other than <i>passed</i> (e.g. failed, stopped, still testing) are considered as <i>failed</i>.</b></td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        <li>You can see the status of the ALM reporting in the console view. <li>Once a comment has been written, you can see the comment in the external repository. From there, you can click on the link provided to open the test result report in the Dashboard that you specified for your Project . The Dashboard must be already running for this action to succeed. The test results must also still be present in the Database <a href="node226.html#TasksReopenTestResult">3.20.3.1</a>. <li>The test result report is opened at the node which referenced the current task ID. <table>
            <tr>

              <td><b>The integration for writing to external repositories can be used with Bugzilla 3.6+, JIRA 5.0+ and HP ALM 11+. Other repositories for which there are Mylyn connectors may also work, but these have not been tested.</b></td>

    <p><span class="textbf">Reporting to ALM repositories after a test started via testexec</span> <a name="TasksALMReportTestExec"></a>For tests started via testexec, the reporting does not happen automatically. Instead, you must choose to report to ALM from the Test Result Summary View . <p>
      <ol>
        <li>In a Project that is configured to report to an ALM repository, when a test has run via testexec, you can open the Reporting Perspective and locate the test run in the Test Result Summary View . <li>In the <i>ALM Report Pending</i> column, you will see whether there are any reports pending. This is based on various factors: <ol>
            <li>ALM Reporting must have been configured for the Project . If no ALM is configured for the Project , then the status in the <i>ALM Report Pending</i> column will be <i>false</i>. <li>The test run must have been designated as relevant. Non-relevant tests show the status <i>false</i> in the <i>ALM Report Pending</i> column. </ol>
        <li>Select any test runs whose results you want to report to ALM, and click on the &quot;<i>Report to ALM</i>&quot; button on the toolbar. You can also select this option from the context-sensitive menu. If you select multiple test runs, the reporting will take place sequentially for each test run. <li>When you select this option, the reporting will be triggered as described above. If the reporting is successful, the status in the <i>ALM Report Pending</i> column changes from <i>true</i> to <i>false</i>. If an error occurs, then the status remains as <i>true</i>. <table>
            <tr>
              <td><img align="BOTTOM" alt="\includegraphics[height=2cm]{lightbulb}" border="0" height="91" src="img2.jpg" width="100" /></td>
              <td><b>If you do not want to report the test results to an ALM tool, you can switch the status of the <i>ALM Report Pending</i> column from <i>true</i> to <i>false</i> by selecting the option to cancel pending reports from the context menu. Toggling the relevance of the test run to <i>false</i> will also set the <i>ALM Report Pending status to <i>false</i>, but this will also mean that the test results are not exported and not considered for BIRT reports <a href="node247.html#testresprefs">3.22.8</a>.</i></b></td>
