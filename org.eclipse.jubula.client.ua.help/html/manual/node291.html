    <p> Although you can use the IDE of your choice to develop your accessibility plug-in, this guide will use Eclipse (specifically, Eclipse 3.4.1 with PDE plug-ins). <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Before setting up your workspace, it is important to have the ECP Remote Control plug-in available, as this contains libraries and interfaces that are required in order to develop your accessibility plug-in. The archive file <i>rcp-support.zip</i>, available from the Jubula installation directory, contains the RCP Remote Control plug-in. Once you have extracted the RCP Remote Control plug-in, you can continue setting up your workspace. <p>
        <li>In order to cleanly separate test code from application code, we recommend using separate workspaces for application and accessibility development. Create a new Eclipse workspace for accessibility plug-in development. <li>Once you have created your new workspace, change that workspace&#39;s Plug-in Development Target Platform to include the RCP Remote Control plug-in, as well as all plug-ins that make up your AUT . Information on configuring the Target Platform plug-ins can be found in Eclipse&#39;s online Help under: <br /><i>Plug-in Development Environment Guide &gt; Tools &gt; Preferences &gt; Target Plug-ins</i>. <p>
        <li>Create a new Plug-in Project. The default values proposed by the New Plug-in Project wizard are acceptable, so simply enter a name for your new Project and complete the wizard without additional modifications. <p>
        <li>You now have a workspace with a properly configured Target Platform as well as a new Plug-in Project. You can now begin developing your accessibility plug-in. </ol>
