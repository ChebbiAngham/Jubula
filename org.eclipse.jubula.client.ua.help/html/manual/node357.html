    <h2><a name="SECTION00822000000000000000"> <span class="arabic">7</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span>.<span class="arabic">2</span> Standards conformance</a></h2> Jubula is designed to test components in their original and intended implementations. If these components have been derived and altered such that they no longer respond to actions in the same way (i.e. rewriting the single-click event for a textbox, non-standard responses to certain key combinations, etc.), Jubula may no longer be able to test these components. <p> It is therefore recommended for the purposes of testing with Jubula - and also for the sake of conformance to usability standards - that the toolkit conventions are held to. <p> There may, of course, be situations where exceptions are necessary. For this reason, Jubula has an API via which testing classes can be implemented so that even changed components can be tested. See the manual on extending Jubula for more information. <p>
