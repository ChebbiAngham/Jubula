    <p> Often, there are errors that occasionally occur at specific points in the test. A good example of this is a prompt dialog that sometimes occurs when saving, for example. For errors that can be expected in some way, you can add Event Handlers to the Test Cases that cause the error to deal with the error and carry on with the test without activating the global Event Handlers . <p> You can use local Event Handlers to specify a particular response to an error at this point - e.g. if you have a check for the existence of a project in the Database and it fails, you may not want to continue with this test. <p> You can also use local Event Handlers to wait for, or create a state in the AUT that you require before the test can continue. In this case, you should structure your Test Case so that it checks for the status you require. If this isn&#39;t the case, the Event Handler is activated and takes the necessary steps to produce the status. Using the <i>retry</i> reentry type <a href="node200.html#reentrytype">3.18.3</a>, you can specify that the failed Test Step (the check) is retried after the Event Handler has been executed. An example of this is below. <p>
