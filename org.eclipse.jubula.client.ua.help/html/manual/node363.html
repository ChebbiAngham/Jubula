      <ol>
        <li>Open a use case in the Test Case Editor . Remember that each use case should be independent, and entirely contained in one single top level Test Case <a href="node349.html#BPKeywordSuites">5.1.3</a>. <li>Add the <i>Action Error</i> Test Case to the use case as an Event Handler <a href="node215.html#customizedehandler">3.21</a>. Specify <i>Action Error</i> as the error type, and <i>return</i> as the reentry type. <li>Add the <i>Check Failed</i> Test Case to the use case as an Event Handler . Specify <i>Check Failed</i> as the error type, and <i>continue</i> as the reentry type. <li>Add the <i>Component Not Found</i> Test Case to the use case as an Event Handler . Specify <i>Component Not Found</i> as the error type, and <i>return</i> as the reentry type. <li>Add the <i>Configuration Error</i> Test Case to the use case as an Event Handler . Specify <i>Configuration Error</i> as the error type, and <i>return</i> as the reentry type. </ol>
    <p> Now, any error in this use case (which is not handled by a local Event Handler within the use case) will result in one of these Event Handlers being activated. <i>Check failed</i> errors will mean that the test continues. <i>Action errors</i>, <i>Component not found</i> and <i>Configuration errors</i> will provoke a restart of the AUT . The test execution leaves the branch in which the Event Handler was nested (the use case) and carries on at the next Test Case (use case) or Test Suite . <table>
        <tr>
          <td><img align="BOTTOM" alt="\includegraphics[height=2cm]{lightbulb}" border="0" height="91" src="img2.jpg" width="100" /></td>
          <td><b>The <i>app_startup</i> Test Case is important at the beginning of each use case in case the AUT has just been restarted <a href="node349.html#BPKeywordSuites">5.1.3</a>. </b></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    <p> Carry out these steps for each use case as you create it. <p> In this way, unexpected errors can be dealt with in a way that allows them to be identified later on. The test does not stop at the error, but tries to carry on at the next relevant point. This is the reason why use cases should be independent from each other - to stop further errors occurring. <p>
