    <p>With Jubula , you can test different language versions of your AUT with the same test. All you have to do is translate the data for the test.<p>To make multilingual testing possible, you have to tell Jubula which languages you are using:<dl>
      <dt><strong>Project language(s):</strong><dd>These languages are specified during Project creation and are valid for all AUT&#39;s in this Project . You will be able to have AUT&#39;s which support one or more of these languages.<dt><strong>Default language:</strong><dd>One of the Project languages is the default language. This is the language which will automatically be set as the working language when you open the Project .<dt><strong>AUT language(s):</strong><dd>When you are defining an AUT , you choose one or more AUT languages from the selection of Project languages. These languages are the languages the AUT supports. You can start the AUT in these languages and write test data for these languages.<dt><strong>The working language:</strong><dd>In the Jubula toolbar, you can change the working language to any of the Project languages. The working language determines which Test Suites you can edit (only those whose AUT supports this language) and the language the AUT is started in.</dl>
