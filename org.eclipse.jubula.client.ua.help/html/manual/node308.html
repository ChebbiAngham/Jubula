      <ol>
        <li>Open the AUT configuration dialog from the Project properties <a href="node53.html#projectproperties">3.5.2</a>. <li>Select the <i>Expert</i> configuration. <li>Select Chronon as the monitoring agent. <li>You can then enter the configuration details for the monitoring. <dl>
            <dt><strong>Package patterns:</strong><dd>Enter a comma-separated list of packages that you want to be covered by the monitoring. The packages must adhere to the patterns as defined in the Chronon documentation, for example <tt>&quot;com.myorg.**&quot;</tt> selects the whole com.myorg namespace. <tt>&quot;com.myorg.*&quot;</tt> selects only classes in the com.myorg package. The documentation for the patterns is located at <br /> https://chronon.onconfluence.com/display/DOC/Include+and+Exclude+patternshttps://chronon.onconfluence.com/display/ <br /> DOC/Include+and+Exclude+patterns. <br /> If you enter no patterns, the recording file will be empty. <dt><strong>Target directory:</strong><dd>Enter the path to a directory where the recording files should be written. The AUT must have write permissions to this place. Any non-existing folders will be automatically created. This target directory and all items it contains are deleted when the AUT is started or restarted. Once the AUT is started, the target directory is recreated ready for the next run. This means you must ensure you have copied any relevant files before starting or restarting the AUT . When the AUT is stopped after a test, the recording file is written to this target directory. The target directory can be relative to the AUT working directory, if you have entered one. <dt><strong>Operating System:</strong><dd>Enter <tt>&quot;win,&quot;</tt> <tt>&quot;lin&quot;</tt>, <tt>&quot;sol&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;mac&quot;</tt> (without quotes) to specify your operating system. <dt><strong>JRE Architecture:</strong><dd>Enter <tt>&quot;32&quot;</tt> or <tt>&quot;64&quot;</tt> (without quotes) to specify your architecture. If you have entered <tt>&quot;mac&quot;</tt> as an operating system, you can only enter <tt>&quot;64&quot;</tt>. </dl>
