This ensures that maintenance is much easier later - you will only have one place to change in the test, instead of many. <p>So what is a keyword? A good example is <i>Login</i>. It is obvious from the name what this Test Case does. It contains three of the Jubula unbound modules from the library Project :<br />
    <ul>
      <li>ub_cti_replaceText (which has the parameter <tt>&quot;TEXT&quot;</tt>)<li>ub_cti_replaceText (which has the parameter <tt>&quot;TEXT&quot;</tt>)<li>ub_grc_clickLeftSingle (no parameters)</ul>
    <p>In this keyword, the two TEXT parameters from the replace text modules would be referenced as <tt>&quot;=USERNAME&quot;</tt> and <tt>&quot;PASSWORD&quot;</tt> <a href="node107.html#TasksTestdataReferences">3.9.3</a>.<p>Any time you need to perform a login in your test, you can reuse this keyword and enter the specific use data each time. This has the advantage that your tests will be easy to read, and that any maintenance you need to do to this keyword can be done in one place.<p>Other things that lend themselves well to being made into keywords are:<ul>
      <li>Synchronized clicks on buttons (e.g. wait for component, then check enablement, then click).<li>Tab selections (e.g. Select Content Tab, Select Options Tab in Tools Dialog).<li>Recurring workflows (e.g. carrying out a search).<li>Anything that you use more than once.</ul>
    <p>Many of these keywords will use the same modules from the unbound modules Project . However, the advantage of making a keyword is that all or most of the data that you need, and the component names, can be encapsulated into a module which has a recognizable name.<p>Some actions cannot be entirely encapsulated into a keyword with no parameters. Actions to enter text or select items from trees often require a different text or textpath each time they are reused. In this case, it is probably not worth writing a separate keyword for each possible data set.<table>
      <tr>
        <td><img align="bottom" border="0" src="img2.jpg" /></td>
        <td><b>If you realise later on in your test that you will need a module again, use the refactor function <a href="node88.html#TasksEditorExtract">3.7.7</a> to extract a reusable Test Case .</b></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
