      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Break</strong><dd>The test execution leaves the Test Case in which the error occurred and continues at the next Test Case or Test Step . <dt><strong>Continue</strong><dd>The test execution carries on at the next Test Case or Test Step . This is a good option when the error is relatively unimportant and does not affect the following Test Steps . <dt><strong>Exit</strong><dd>The test execution is stopped. Use this when the error is so severe that the test cannot be continued. <dt><strong>Return</strong><dd>The test execution leaves the Test Case in which the activated Event Handler is nested. This could be the current Test Case or one higher up in the hierarchy. This option is useful if you have a use case, which contains Test Cases to test a particular area or function. You can decide to leave this part of the test, and carry on at the next use case. <i>Return</i> will continue at the next Test Suite in a Test Job if it is activated as a default Event Handler or if there are no further steps in the current Test Suite . <dt><strong>Pause</strong><dd>The test execution is paused. To restart the test, click the <i>pause</i> button in the toolbar in the Jubula client . <dt><strong>Retry</strong><dd>The failed Test Step is repeated as many times as you specify in the Properties View . If the Test Step is successful on repeating, it is marked as successful after retrying. If the Test Step fails on all retries, the error type is passed on to the next parent Test Case and this Test Step (and therefore the test) is marked as failed. </dl>
