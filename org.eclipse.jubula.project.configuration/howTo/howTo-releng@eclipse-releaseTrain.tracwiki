== General information ==
We build on an hourly base triggered whenever necessary (by an SCM change) on http://hudson.eclipse.org using Maven3

 * [https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/job/jubula-nightly/ Jubula Hudson - nightly]
 * '''only ''' this job (e.g. no maintenance jobs) must publish its artifacts to "http://download.eclipse.org/jubula/development" - this p2-repository is used within our target-definitions of the ITE standalone version

In addition to this there are - for each individual release train version - the following targets available: 
 * [https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/job/jubula-helios/ Jubula Hudson - 3.6 - helios]
 * [https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/job/jubula-indigo/ Jubula Hudson - 3.7 - indigo]
 * [https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/job/jubula-juno/ Jubula Hudson - 4.2 - juno]
 * [https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/job/jubula-kepler/ Jubula Hudson - 4.3 - kepler]
 * [https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/job/jubula-luna/ Jubula Hudson - 4.4 - luna]
 * [https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/job/jubula-mars/ Jubula Hudson - 4.5 - mars]

To get a new CI job simply "reopen" the following bug providing all necessary information: http://eclip.se/334525

The general aggregation process can be easily tracked here (e.g. job name = "<currentReleaseTrainName>.runAggregator"):
 * https://hudson.eclipse.org/hudson/view/Repository%20Aggregation/
 * EPP Testing Package Maintaining Enhancement Request[[BR]]http://eclip.se/344369

Signed artifacts can only be created within the  Eclipse common build infrastructure - its being activated (the maven profile) by a set environment option "'''-Dbuild.env=eclipse.org'''" for the mvn3 invoke of the CI job
