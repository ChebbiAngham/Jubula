	The "SNAPSHOT" in the include selector ensures that only the non-source
	JAR is used. Without it, the corresponding source JAR was being used,
	and it was either being used exclusively or was *overwriting* the content
	provided by the non-source JAR. This caused compilation to fail when also
	building source bundles.
