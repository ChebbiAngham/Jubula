         A Project is the container for AUT&apos;s and their configurations. <br/><br/>
If you have multilingual AUT&apos;s, you can specify Project languages.
      </description>
      <subitem label="An AUT configuration contains details on how to start the AUT." skip="false">
      </subitem>
      <subitem label="You can add different languages to your Project which are supported by your AUT. In this way you can easily test different versions of your AUT." skip="false">
      </subitem>
      <subitem label="You choose the toolkit for your AUT when defining the AUT. The toolkit is the library used to create the AUT&apos;s GUI." skip="false">

      <description>
         Test Cases are reusable modules, like keywords.<br/><br/>

      <subitem label="No programming is needed to create Test Cases." skip="false">
      </subitem>
      <subitem label="Test Case creation can begin before you even have your application. The earlier you create tests, the more efficient your test process." skip="false">
      </subitem>
      <subitem label="Test Cases can be added (via referencing) to other Test Cases. In this way, large and complex tests can be created from a small number of Test Cases." skip="false">
      </subitem>
      <subitem label="The advantage of this is the flexibility of your tests. Tests are easy to maintain." skip="false">
      </subitem>
      <subitem label="Data can be kept separate from the test flow, which also reduces maintenance effort." skip="false">
      </subitem>
      <subitem label="By spending some time thinking about structuring your tests, you can save time and money while improving quality." skip="false">
      </subitem>
      <subitem label="The value of test automation is in the stability of regression testing. GUIdancer lets you gain maximum benefit from regression tests, because maintenance efforts are so low." skip="false">
