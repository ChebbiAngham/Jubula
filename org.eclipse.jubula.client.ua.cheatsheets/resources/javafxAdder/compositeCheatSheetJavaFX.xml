      <intro>
         These cheat sheets take you step-by-step through your first test with JavaFX. 
<br/><br/>
The requirements for the program we want to test are as follows:
<br/><br/>
1. A small calculator which can perform an addition<br/><br/>
2. There will be two text entry areas and an equals button<br/><br/>
3. The result of the addition will be shown in the interface<br/>
<br/>
Your task is to create a test which will test this functionality via the GUI.
<br/><br/>
Make sure that the Integrated Test Environment (ITE)  is maximized to complete these cheat sheets!

         <task kind="cheatsheet" name="Create a Project" skip="false">
            <intro>
               A Project contains information about the AUT and also contains the Test Cases to test the AUT.
            </intro>
            <onCompletion>
               You will notice that there is a category of blue Test Cases in the Test Case browser. This is a pre-defined library of Test Cases to make test creation easier. We will use these later to create the test.

            <intro>
               Each AUT can have one or more configurations. 
<br/><br/>
A configuration contains details about how to start the AUT.
<br/><br/>
For example, you need to define where to start your AUT (on what computer) and with what arguments. 
<br/><br/>
Some AUT&apos;s will need different configurations so that they can be tested on different platforms.
            </intro>
            <onCompletion>
               It may be necessary to change or add other information in the AUT configuration dialog when you configure your own AUT - especially if you are working with the AUT on another machine. <br/><br/> 
There is more information on configuring AUT&apos;s in the handbook, in the <b>Tasks</b> chapter.  <br/><br/>
You can also see context-sensitive help by pressing <b>F1</b> in the AUT configuration dialog.

            You have now seen how easy it is to create tests using the library we installed.

            <intro>
               Now you will create a Test Case to make the program perform an addition and check the result.
<br/><br/>
Test Cases are reusable modules. 
<br/><br/>
Note that the following steps are all completed based on the requirements for the AUT - we are not dependent on the AUT to create tests.

            <onCompletion>
               This task has shown you how to use the library of Test Cases to create tests. Test Cases are not copied, they are referenced. You always only have one source - which makes maintainability easier later.

               The benefit of adding the data here is that it is separate from the test flow. It can easily be changed, read from a central test data set, or translated.
