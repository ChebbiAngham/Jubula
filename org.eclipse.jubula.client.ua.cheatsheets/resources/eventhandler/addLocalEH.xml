   <intro>
      <description>
         The following steps show you how an Event Handler can be used to select the checkbox and continue with the test.

      <subitem
            label="In the Test Case Browser, open the category: &quot;unbound_modules_concrete/Actions(basic)/Click&quot;">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="Drag the Test Case &quot;ub_grc_clickLeft_single&quot; into the Event Handler area in the Test Case Editor for the &quot;Check if checkbox is selected&quot; Test Case.">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="In the dialog that appears, specify &quot;Check Failed&quot; as the error type and &quot;Retry&quot; as the reentry type. Leave the amount of retries at 1. Click OK. This means that the Event Handler will be activated when a check failed action occurs. Once the Event Handler has been executed, the failed step will be retried.">
      </subitem>
      <subitem
            label="In the component names view for the Event Handler, enter the same name as you entered for the checkbox component i.e. TechnicsTab_Bonus_btc">
      </subitem>
   </item>
   <item
         title="Execute the test">
      <description>
         Save the Test Case Editor and re-execute the test. You will see that the Event Handler selects the checbox and then re-performs the failed action (i.e. the check). This is successful the second time, and the test can continue. <br/><br/>
If you execute the test a second time without deselecting the checkbox, you will see that the Event Handler does not get activated, as no error occurs.
