  <title>Concrete toolkit tooltip component</title>
  <para>
  	The tooltip is a graphical user interface element. It is used in conjunction with a cursor, usually a pointer. 
  	The user hovers the pointer over an item, without clicking it, and a tooltip may appear â€” a small "hover box" 
  	with information about the item being hovered over.
  </para>
  
  <para role="warning">
    JFace tooltips in the RCP toolkit are handled diffently since the tooltip itself is recognized as a component on its own.
    To collect the tooltip move the mouse pointer over the component which includes the tooltip and 
    wait for it to show up then perform the Object Mapping.
    You will recognize that two or more components will be collected: the component including the tooltip and the tooltip itself.
    Since the tooltip is mostly hiding after mouse movement this can only be done if the object mapping mode is using a key combination.
