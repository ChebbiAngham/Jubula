  		<listitem>In tables you can address the header of a table either by using its index
  		or by entering its title</listitem>
  		<listitem>The first column is '1' (without quotes) and so on. The index '0' (without
  		quotes)refers to the header itself</listitem>
  		<listitem>If the cell you want to execute an action on is in fourth column and is 
  		called <emphasize>Price</emphasize>, you can address the column either with the index
  		'4' or with the string <emphasize>Price</emphasize></listitem>
  		<listitem>Turning the function on when it is already on will not have any effect.
  		The function remains on.</listitem>
  		<listitem>In JavaFX AUTÂ´s, you can also enter a path to the column to test tables that have
  		nested columns (i.e. where a column has child columns). Enter the column as a path, 
  		separated with forward slash, e.g. <emphasize>Address/Street</emphasize>. You can use
  		indexpaths and textpaths for columns in JavaFX tables.</listitem>
