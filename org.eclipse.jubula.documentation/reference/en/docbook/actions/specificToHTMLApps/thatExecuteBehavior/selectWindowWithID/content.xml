  <title>Select Window with Identifier</title>
  
  <para>
    Use this action to switch to a new window that your HTML AUT has opened during the test, or to switch back to the main window once you have performed steps in a second window.
    Without using Webdrivers, in order to allow this, you must have specified the AUT as supporting multi-window mode in the AUT configuration.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    This action allows you to use the window title or other identifiers to select the window.
    The behavior is different depending on whether you use Webdrivers.
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Without Webdrivers, you can set the identifier type to <emphasis role="strong">title</emphasis>, <emphasis role="strong">name</emphasis>
          or <emphasis role="strong">any</emphasis>.
          If <emphasis role="strong">title</emphasis> or <emphasis role="strong">name</emphasis> is used, the window is selected using these properties.
          However, if you choose <emphasis role="strong">any</emphasis>, then as identifier, you must enter an expression of the form <literal>'var=variable_name'</literal>.
          In this case the current window is searched for a variable with name <literal>variable_name</literal>, and if it contains a popup window's reference, that
          popup window is opened.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          With Webdrivers, the only available options are <emphasis role="strong">title</emphasis> and <emphasis role="strong">name</emphasis>,
          which work the same way as explained above.
