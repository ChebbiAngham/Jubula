          Use this action to interact with (accept or dismiss) a prompt, alert or confirmation.

        <para>
        Alerts, prompts and confirmations are not shown during test execution, but they must 
        still be handled in the test. You must use the actions to deal with the prompt, alert or
        confirmation just before the item appears. The actions are designed to deal with the next prompt, alert or confirmation
        that appears and not while it is already open. 
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
      	<para>
      	The behavior you specify for interacting with one alert, prompt or confirmation will be taken as 
      	default for the next one. To avoid confusion in your tests, we recommend explicitly dealing with each 
      	prompt, alert or confirmation separately, even if the action for two consecutive ones is the same.
