  <title>Wait for component (based on locator)</title>
 
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Use this action to wait for an element based on its locator.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
        The action requires no component name and no object mapping - the element 
        in your AUT is found based on the locator you enter.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
      	<para>
      	For example, you can enter an xpath locator like this:
      	</para> 
      	<para><emphasis role="input">xpath=...</emphasis></para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
      	<para>
      	You can enter a CSS locator like this:
      	</para> 
      	<para><emphasis role="input">css=...</emphasis></para>
      	<para>
      	You will most likely want to use single quotes around the whole
      	locator to cancel out any special characters within the string. 
      	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
        You can use different types of locators, and can find out the locator for 
        your element using website inspection tools. For example, 
        you can copy a unique selector (CSS Locator) for an item. 
        </para>
