      <listitem>
        <para>
          Use this action to check how many items with a certain CSS locator 
          are found. You can compare the amount found with a value you specify.
        </para>

      <listitem>
        <para>
        The action requires no component name and no object mapping. You enter the 
        CSS locator (without the css prefix) as the locator. 
        </para>

      <listitem>
        <para>
        You can use different types of locators, and can find out the locator for 
        your component using website inspection tools. For example, the Firefox developer
        options allow you to copy the unique selector (CSS Locator) for an item.
