        Alerts, prompts and confirmations are not shown during test execution, but they must 
        still be handled in the test. You must use the actions to deal with the prompt, alert or
        confirmation just before the item appears. The actions are designed to deal with the next prompt, alert or confirmation
        that appears and not while it is already open.
