\label{overviewabstcomp}
The following diagram shows which abstract components \app{} uses and for which actions they can be used for.  


\begin{figure}

Figure \ref{comp} provides an overview of \app{}'s concrete and abstract component structure. This figure can be interpreted as follows: the arrows show inheritance relations between the components. Thus, a \bxname{Label} component has no actions of its own, but inherits them all from \bxname{Component with Text}. The \bxname{Label} component also inherits any actions that \bxname{Component with Text} also inherited. In this case, these are the actions from \bxname{Graphics component}.
