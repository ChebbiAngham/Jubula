Figure \ref{comp} provides an overview of \GD's concrete and abstract component structure. This figure can be interpreted as follows: the arrows show inheritance relations between the components. Thus, a \bxname{Label} component has no actions of its own, but inherits them all from \bxname{Component with Text}. The \bxname{Label} component also inherits any actions that \bxname{Component with Text} also inherited. In this case, these are the actions from \bxname{Graphics component}.
