% CAP description for Graphics Component --> Click in Component --> y-position
  \begin{itemize}
\item With this parameter, you can specify where in the component you should click.
\item Use this parameter to enter a value for the y-axis (the vertical position).
\item Using the y-units parameter, you can specify whether the value should be in pixels or in percent. 
\item For example, if you enter \bxshell{50} and then \bxshell{percent}, then the click will be performed in the middle of the y-axis.
\item All positions are calculated from the upper left of the component, with the positive y-axis stretching toward the bottom of the component.
