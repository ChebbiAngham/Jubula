% CAP description for Menu Bar --> Verify Exists --> Menupath
   
\begin{itemize}
\item Use this parameter to enter the menupath you want to check. 
\item Enter the menupath as a textpath.
\item For example, if you want to check that the menupath:\\
\bxmenu{File}{Close}{}\\
exists, then enter \bxshell{File/Close} as a parameter.
\bxwarn{The  check is only performed on the final item in the menupath (e.g. File/Import/\textbf{Picture}). If a menu item before that is missing, it produces an action error. }
\item Make sure you give the whole menupath (start from the very beginning of the menu).
\item Make sure that your path is written exactly as it appears in the menu. 
\item Use slash {\tt '/'} to separate menu entries.
\end{itemize}
