% CAP description for Application --> Restart

\begin{itemize}
\item Use this action to restart the \gdaut{} during the test. 
\item The action closes your \gdaut{} and all windows/dialogs associated with it. 
\item It then starts the same \gdaut{} with the same configuration as it had when you originally started it and carries on with the test. 
\item If your \gdaut{} takes a while to load/to be ready, it is a good idea to use the \bxcaption{wait for window} or \bxcaption{wait for component} action after the restart action. 
\end{itemize}
