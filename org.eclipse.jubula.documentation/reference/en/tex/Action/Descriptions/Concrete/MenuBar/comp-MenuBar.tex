Because the forward slash (/) is a special symbol for menus, if you want to use a slash as part of your parameter value, you have to mask it. See the section later in this document \bxpref{specialchar} for more details. 

\textbf{Mapping menu bars}

Menu bars do not need to be mapped in the \gdomm{} as they are automatically found during test execution.

\bxtipp{Actions on menus are not supported in the HTML toolkit.}
