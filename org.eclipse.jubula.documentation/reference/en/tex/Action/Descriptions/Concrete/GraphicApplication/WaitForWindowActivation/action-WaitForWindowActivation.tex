% CAP description for Application --> Wait for Window Activation
\begin{itemize}
\item This action waits for the window you name to become active. A window is active only when it is the currently selected window.
\item Once the window is active (or if the window is already active when this test step begins), the test continues.
\item If the window does not become active, the action fails.
\end{itemize}
