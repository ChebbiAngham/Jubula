% CAP description for Application --> Manual Test Step --> Timeout in ms

\begin{itemize}
\item Enter the amount of time to wait for the execution of the manual \gdstep{}, in milliseconds.
\item If the manual \gdstep{} is not manually passed or failed by the tester in this time, the action is marked as failed. 
\bxtipp{We recommend entering a higher timeout for manual \gdsteps{} than for automated ones, as a human tester may need more time to perform the action(s) and document any errors.}
\end{itemize}
