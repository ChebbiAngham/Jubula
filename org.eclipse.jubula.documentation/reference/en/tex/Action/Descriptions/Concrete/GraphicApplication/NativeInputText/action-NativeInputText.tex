% CAP description for Application --> External Input Text

\begin{itemize}
\item Use this action to input text into dialogs that are not supported by \app{} (e.g. file choosers). 
\item \app{} can send keystrokes to these dialogs, but cannot check if they have arrived. 
\item For this action to work, the dialog must be in focus, and the cursor must be in the text field to be filled in. 
\item Combine this action with the \bxcaption{External Key Combination} action to send key combinations to native dialogs to be able to work with file choosers during your test. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Native dialogs in SWT and RCP \gdauts{}}\\

In SWT and RCP \gdauts{}, this action can only enter ASCII characters (large and small letters, and numbers). 

To enter characters such as spaces, periods and slashes, use the action \bxname{External Key Combination}. 

We recommend using the action \bxname{Copy to Clipboard} to help fill out native dialogs in SWT and RCP \gdauts{}. The string you copy to the clipboard can then simply be entered into the textfield in the dialog using \bxkey{Ctrl+V} as an \bxname{External Key Combination} action.
