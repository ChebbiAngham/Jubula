% CAP description for Application --> Key Combination
\begin{itemize}
\item This action allows you to send a key command to the application. 
\item This is useful for actions such as \bxkey{delete}, \bxkey{enter}, etc.
\end{itemize}
\bxtipp{Under Swing, this action only supports the American character set. Under SWT, you can use any character set under Windows, but there are some problems with non-American characters under Linux. }

\bxwarn{In HTML, on Firefox, the keys \bxkey{F5} and \bxkey{Escape} cannot be used.}

\bxtipp{Users working on Linux systems should increase the \bxname{key repeat delay} on their test system or remove it completely. Some Linux systems can otherwise tend to repeat key presses which can lead to undesired actions being produced during test execution.}
