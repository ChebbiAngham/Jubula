% CAP description for Application --> Execute External Command --> Command

\begin{itemize}
\item Use this parameter to tell \app{} which command to execute.
\item Give the path to the command, either on the local machine or on the remote machine, as defined in the \bxname{local} parameter. 
\item Relative paths can be written simply with the white spaces included. You will need to use quotes (") around the path or command if you are using path fragments (e.g. \bxshell{./} or \bxshell{../}) for the relative path.  
\item When using absolute paths, use quotes (") around the command or parameter containing the whitespaces. 
\item You need to use quotes for path fragments as 

For example, instead of: \\
\verb+C:\Program Files\guidancer\guidancer.exe +
\newline
\verb+-data C:\Program Files\guidancer\ws +
\newline
enter:\\
\verb+"C:\Program Files\guidancer\guidancer.exe" +
\newline
\verb+ -data "C:\Program Files\guidancer\ws" +

\item In Linux, quotes may be placed around the command and the parameter. Windows cmd.exe can only accept quotes in either the parameter or the command. 
\item Please bear in mind that strings within the quotes are not checked for validity. 

\end{itemize}
\bxtipp{Use .cmd commands instead of .bat commands.}
