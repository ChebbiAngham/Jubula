% CAP description for Application --> Input Text

\begin{itemize}
\item Use this action to enter text into the component which currently has focus.
\item The text you want to enter is given as a parameter.
\item The difference between this action and the \bxcaption{External Input Text} is that \jb{} can check that the keystrokes have arrived at the component. 
\item Use this action for components that \jb{} supports, and the  \bxcaption{External Input Text} action for components in external dialogs, such as file choosers. 
\end{itemize}


\bxtipp{In HTML \gdauts{}, this action can only be used with alphanumeric characters. Also, if the focus is not currently on the browser, then this action will not be successful.}
