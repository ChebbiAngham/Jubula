% CAP description for Application --> Execute External Command --> Local

\begin{itemize}
\item Use this parameter to define whether the command should be run locally (on the client machine, the same machin as \app{} is installed on) or remotely (on the machine where the \gdagent{} is installed, and the \gdaut{} is running.). 
\item Set this parameter to true to run the command locally.
\item Set this parameter to \app{}efbooleanfalse to run the command remotely. 
\bxtipp{If you are running your \gdaut{} on the same machine as the \app{} client, there is no difference between running the command locally or remotely.}
\item  For information on using relative paths to the location of the commands on local and remote machines, see the section in this document \bxpref{relativepath}.
