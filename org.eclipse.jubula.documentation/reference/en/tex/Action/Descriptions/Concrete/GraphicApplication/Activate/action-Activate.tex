% CAP description for Application --> Activate
\label{activate}
\begin{itemize}
\item When the \gd{} client and \gdserver are running on the same computer, you may need to bring the \gdaut{} into focus before a test can begin.
\item Exactly how to \bxname{activate} the application can vary from one system to another.
\item This action offers various different ways of activating the application.
\item \gd{} realises this action by clicking in the location indicated in the \bxname{activation method} parameter.
\item In the \gdaut{} configuration \bxextref{\gduserman}{user,configuringaut}, the default is that no activation is carried out. 
\item You can set an activation method for the whole \gdaut{} in  its configuration, and use this in your \gdsteps{} (e.g. set the activation method parameter to \bxcaption{AUT\_DEFAULT}) or you can use a different activation method.
\item In this way, you can centrally define a default for a given operating system, which you can easily change when you test on another operating system.
\item Using the activate action, you can also specify activation methods which differ from the default.

 
\bxtipp{This action is used to ensure that an \gdaut{} has the current focus. It cannot be used to maximize a minimized \gdaut{}. }
