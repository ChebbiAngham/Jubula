% CAP description for Application --> Synchronize termination and re-start of AUT

\begin{itemize}
\item Use this action together with the action to prepare for \gdaut{} termination and an action to close your \gdaut{}. 
\item Using these actions, you can close your \gdaut{} using e.g. \bxmenu{File}{Exit}{} and have it automatically restarted.
\bxwarn{Using the \bxname{Restart} option in Eclipse \gdauts{} is not supported.}
\item Use this action sometime after using the prepare for termination action, and directly after the action to close the \gdaut{}. 
\bxwarn{The shutdown method you choose must run through the JVM shutdown hooks to properly terminate the \gdaut{}. Do not use the \bxname{restart} action to shut your \gdaut{} down.}
\item The action works by waiting for the \gdaut{} to terminate (configurable via a parameter), then re-starting the \gdaut{} using the same configuration / autrun parameters as it was originally started with.
\item You may want to follow this action with a module that waits for your \gdaut{} to be started completely.
\end{itemize}

\bxwarn{This action is currently supported on the Swing and RCP toolkits. Neither toolkit supports the terminating of \gdauts{} using the \bxname{press any key} actions to press e.g. \bxkey{Alt+F4}. External key combinations can be used to terminate the \gdaut{} using e.g. \bxkey{Alt+F4} on RCP \gdauts{}, but not Swing \gdauts{}.}
