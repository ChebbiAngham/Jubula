% CAP description for Tabbed Pane --> Select Tab by Index
\begin{itemize}
\item Use this action to select/activate a tab.
\item You choose the tab to select by giving its index.
\item \app{} realises this by clicking on the tab whose index you enter.
\item In RCP \gdauts{}, the index of the tab refers to the order in which the tabs were opened. So the first tab to be opened has an index of \bxshell{1}. This action selects the tab  even if the tab with the given index is currently not visible (e.g. in the editor view).
