% CAP description for Tree --> Verify Textpath
\begin{itemize}
\item This action checks that a node in the tree exists.
\item You give the path to the node you want to check as a textpath. 
\item For example, checking a textpath of ''Dog/Bird/Cat'' would check whether  an entry ''Cat'' exists beneath an entry for ''Bird'' in the tree,
which furthermore lies beneath an entry ''Dog''.
\end{itemize}
