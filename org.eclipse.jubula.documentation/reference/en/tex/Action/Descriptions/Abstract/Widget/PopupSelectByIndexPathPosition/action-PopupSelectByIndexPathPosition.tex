% CAP description for Graphics Component --> Context Menu by Indexpath (Specify Position)
\begin{itemize}
\item Use this action to open the context-sensitive menu from the currently active component and to select an item from it.
\item The menu item is selected using its indexpath. 
\item This is realized by:
\begin{itemize}
\item Right-clicking in the component.
\item The position to click is specified by the x- and y- coordinate parameters.
\item Navigating to the menu item specified.
\item Left-clicking on the menu option.  
\end{itemize}
\item This action will click in the position you specify in the component.
\item This can sometimes produce a different context-sensitive menu than when you click on a specific node/cell etc.
\item If you want to open a context-sensitive menu on a specific node or cell, then use the action which selects the context menu without specifying the coordinate position.

\end{itemize}

\bxtipp{This action is unsupported for the HTML toolkit}
