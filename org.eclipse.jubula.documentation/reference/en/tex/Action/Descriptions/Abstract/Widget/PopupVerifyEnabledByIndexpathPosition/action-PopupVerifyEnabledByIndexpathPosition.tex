% CAP description for Graphics Component --> Check Enablement of Context Menu Entry by Indexpath (Specify Position)

\begin{itemize}
\item Use this action to check the enablement status of an item in a context menu.
\item The item to check is given using the indexpath to the item.
\item The context menu is opened at a specific place in the component, specified by the x- and y- coordinates. 
\item This can sometimes produce a different context menu than when you click on a specific node/cell etc.
\item If you want to check a context-sensitive menu on a specific node or cell in a component, then use the action which checks the context menu without specifying the coordinate position.
\item You can also define which mouse button should be used to open the context menu. 
\end{itemize}
\bxtipp{This action is unsupported for the HTML toolkit}
