% CAP description for Graphics Component --> Verify Property
\begin{itemize}
\item Use this action to check a specific property of a component. 
\item You can check whether a value you enter for a given property matches the actual value for the property.
\item Every component has properties (attributes). These can include the text size, the size (width/height) of the component, the color etc
\item You must first find out the name of the property you want to check, and then what value it should have. 
\end{itemize}
\bxtipp{If the property is \bxname{private}, it cannot be checked, as \app{} has no access to it.}

\bxtipp{When testing HTML \gdauts{}, there are some differences between the properties available in Internet Explorer and Firefox. Some properties available in FF may not be retrievable under IE.}
