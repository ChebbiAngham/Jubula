% CAP description for Graphics Component --> Store Property

\begin{itemize}
\item Use this action to store the value of a specific property of a component.
\item You can then use this value later in your test, or check whether two values you store are the same or different using the actions to Check Numeric Values and Check String Values on the Application component. 
\item Every component has properties (attributes). These can include the text size, the size (width/height) of the component, the color etc.
\item You must first find out the name of the property you want to check, and then what value it should have. You can find out what properties and values a component has in the \gdomm{} (for Swing and SWT/RCP \gdauts{}). When you collect a component, its property information is displayed in the \gdpropview{}. 
\end{itemize}
\bxtipp{If the property is \bxname{private}, it cannot be stored, the remote control component has no access to it.}
