% CAP description for Component with Text Input --> Replace Text
\begin{itemize}
\item Use this action to replace any text already in the text field.
\item The text you want to enter is given as a parameter.
\item This is realized by:
\begin{itemize}
\item Selecting any text already in the component. 
\item Entering the text you specified. This effectively overwrites the previous text in the component. 
\end{itemize}
\item This means that any previous text in the component is deleted. 
\item To enter text before/after previous text, see \bxcaption{Insert Text Before/After Pattern} in the \bxcaption{Text Field} component.
\end{itemize}
