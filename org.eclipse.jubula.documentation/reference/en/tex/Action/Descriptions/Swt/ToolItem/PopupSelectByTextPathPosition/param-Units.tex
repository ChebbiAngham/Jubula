% CAP description for Toolbar Item --> Context Menu by Textpath (Specify Position) --> Units

\begin{itemize}
\item Use this parameter to specify how the x- and y-coordinates should be interpreted. 
\item Set the parameter to \bxshell{pixels} if you want the values you enter to be in pixels.
\item Set the parameter to \bxshell{percent} if you want the values you enter to be in percent.
\item All values are calculated from the upper left of the component. 
\item For example, if you have \bxshell{50} for both the x- and y-coordinates, and use percent as the units, the context-menu will be opened from the middle of the component.
\item If you use pixels with the same values, then the context-sensitive menu will be opened from a position which is 50 pixels from the upper left horizontally and vertically. 
\end{itemize}
