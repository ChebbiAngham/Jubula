% CAP description for Toolbar Item --> Verify Property

\begin{itemize}
\item Use this action to check whether a value you enter for a given property matches the actual value for the property.
\item The properties can include the text size, the size (width/height) of the component, the color etc.
\item Sometimes it is required that a test checks these properties. 
\item Checking properties is a more complex process than other \jb{} actions. 
\item You must first find out the name of the property you want to check, and then what value it should have. 
\item Some commmon property names include:\\
\bxshell{color}, \bxshell{background}, \bxshell{pointsize}, \bxshell{width}, \bxshell{height}. 
\end{itemize}
\bxtipp{If the property is \bxname{private}, it cannot be checked, as \jb{} has no access to it.}
