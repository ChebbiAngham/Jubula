% CAP description for (SWT) Tree

A tree in SWT is essentially the same as a tree in Swing, with an extra option to have chackboxes on the nodes of the tree. Use this component if you want to select or check the selection of the checkboxes on an SWT tree. For other actions on trees, use the tree component in the \bxname{concrete} toolkit.
