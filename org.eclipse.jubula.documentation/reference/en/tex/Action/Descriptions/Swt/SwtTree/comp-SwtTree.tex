% CAP description for Tree Table

A tree table is an SWT component which has some of the proeprties of a tree (e.g. nodes which can be expanded or collapsed) and some of the properties of a table (e.g. rows and columns). 

Because the forward slash (/) is a special symbol for trees, if you want to use a slash as part of your parameter value, you have to mask it. See the section later in this document \bxpref{specialchar} for more details.
