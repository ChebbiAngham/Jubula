% CAP description for HTML Hyperlink

A HTML hyperlink is a link which can be followed from within a browser. 

\bxwarn{Please be aware that HTML hyperlinks are identified based on their complete URL. This means that the technical name for a component changes if the hostname changes, and that the object mapping must be updated. Where possible, we recommend using one hostname for all web tests.}
