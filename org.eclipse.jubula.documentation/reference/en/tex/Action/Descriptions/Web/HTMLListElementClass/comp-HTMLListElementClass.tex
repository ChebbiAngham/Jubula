% CAP description for HTML List

The HTML list is similar to lists in the concrete toolkit, with the addition that it can be cleared so that it is empty. 

Because the comma (,) is a special symbol for lists, if you want to use a comma as part of your parameter value, you have to mask it. See the section later in this document \bxpref{specialchar} for more details.
