\begin{itemize}
\item Use this parameter with a \bxname{relative path} to start the search above the currently selected node.
\item The search will begin \emph{n} nodes above the currently selected node, where \emph{n} is the value of this parameter.
\item For example, a value of 0 will simply begin with the currently selected node, and a value of 2 will begin with the parent of the parent of the currently selected node.
\item A value can be given such that the search begins 1 level above the topmost visible level. This is then equivalent to an \bxname{absolute path}.
\item If the search would begin any higher than this, the action fails: The tree node cannot be found.
