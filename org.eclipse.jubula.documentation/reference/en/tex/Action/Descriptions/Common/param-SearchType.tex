\item The \bxname{search type} parameter has two options. 
\item  \bxcaption{absolute} begins searching for the value at the first entry.
\item Select \bxcaption{relative} to begin the search for the value after the currently selected entry. This allows you to search for the next occurence of a value, ignoring all elements before and including the selected entry. 
\end{itemize}
