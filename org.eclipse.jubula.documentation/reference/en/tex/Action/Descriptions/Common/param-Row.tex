\begin{itemize}
\item In tables, you can address the row of a table either by using its index or by entering the value in the first column of the particular row. 
%\bxtipp{You can only enter the value in the row using the operator \bxname{equals}.}
\item The first row is \bxshell{1} and so on.
\item The row of table headers at the top of the table can be addressed using the index \bxshell{0}. 
\item If the cell you want to execute an action on is in the fourth row and  contains the value \bxname{Price} in the first column, you can address the row  either with the index \bxshell{4} or with the string \bxname{Price}.  
\end{itemize}
