 \begin{itemize}
\item With this parameter, you can specify where in the component you should click.
\item Use this parameter to enter a value for the x-axis (the horizontal position).
\item Using the x-units parameter, you can specify whether the value should be in pixels or in percent. 
\item For example, if you enter \bxshell{50} and then \bxshell{percent}, then the click will be performed in the middle of the x-axis.
\item All positions are calculated from the upper left of the component, with the positive x-axis stretching toward the right side of the component.
\bxtipp{We recommend not using \bxshell{0} (pixels and percent) or \bxshell{100}(percent) as positions.}
