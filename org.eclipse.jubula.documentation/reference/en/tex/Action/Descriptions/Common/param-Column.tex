\begin{itemize}
\item In tables, you can address the header of a table either by using its index or by entering its title. 
\item The first column is \bxshell{1} (without quotes)  and so on. The index \bxshell{0} (without quotes) refers to the header itself. 
\item If the cell you want to execute an action on is in the fourth column and is called \bxname{Price}, you can address the column either with the index \bxshell{4} (without quotes) or with the string \bxname{Price}. 
\item In JavaFX \gdauts{}, you can also enter a path to the column to test tables that have nested columns (i.e. where a column has child columns). Enter the column as a path, separated with a forward slash, e.g. \bxshell{Address/Street}. You can use indexpaths and textpaths for columns in JavaFX tables.
