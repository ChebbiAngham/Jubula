\begin{itemize}
\item In tables, you can address the header of a table either by using its index or by entering its title. 
%\bxtipp{You can only enter the title using the operator \bxname{equals}.}
\item The first column is \bxshell{1} and so on. The index \bxshell{0} refers to the header itself. 
\item If the cell you want to execute an action on is in the fourth column and is called \bxname{Price}, you can address the column either with the index \bxshell{4} or with the string \bxname{Price}. 

\end{itemize}   

\bxtipp{Actions on tree tables (SWT and RCP) can only be carried out using the column number, not the header title.}
