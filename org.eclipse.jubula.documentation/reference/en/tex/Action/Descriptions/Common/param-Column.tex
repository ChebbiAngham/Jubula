\begin{itemize}
\item In tables, you can address the header of a table either by using its index or by entering its title. 
\item The first column is \bxshell{1} (without quotes)  and so on. The index \bxshell{0} (without quotes) refers to the header itself. 
\item If the cell you want to execute an action on is in the fourth column and is called \bxname{Price}, you can address the column either with the index \bxshell{4} (without quotes) or with the string \bxname{Price}. 

\end{itemize}   

%\bxtipp{Actions on tree tables (SWT and RCP) can only be carried out using the column number, not the header title.}
