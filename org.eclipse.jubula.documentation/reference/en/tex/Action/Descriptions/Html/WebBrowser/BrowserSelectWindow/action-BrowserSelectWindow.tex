% CAP description for Browser --> Select window with identifier

Use this action to switch to a new window that your HTML \gdaut{} has opened during the test, or to switch back to the main window once you have performed steps in a second window. In order to allow this, you must have specified the \gdaut{} as supporting multi-window mode in the \gdaut{} configuration. 

This action allows you to use the window title or other identifiers to select the window.
