  <title>AUT Agent</title>
  <para>
    Although the automatic AUT Agent selection generally selects the
    correct AUT Agent, it can be useful to know what criteria go
    into the selection process. These rules are followed when
    deciding with which AUT Agent the starting AUT should be
    registered:
  </para>
  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        If the ITE is currently connected to an AUT Agent, then that
        AUT Agent will be used.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        If an embedded AUT Agent is running, the ITE will connect to
        the embedded AUT Agent and use that for AUT registration.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        An embedded AUT Agent will be started, and the connection
        will be made and used for AUT registration.
