        You can also define the version numbers for the Project that should 
        be created or use the suggested version number. See the section on 
        Project versions for more information on version numbers 
        (<xref linkend="projectversion"/>).

        Otherwise, any modifications are saved under the new Project

        Any test result summaries for the Project are not duplicated in the
        new Project. Tests that ran for previous versions of the
        Project are, however, still in the database to be used for
        long term analysis.
