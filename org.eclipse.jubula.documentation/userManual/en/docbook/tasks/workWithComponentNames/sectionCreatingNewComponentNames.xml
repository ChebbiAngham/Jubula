  <para>
    For information on creating new component names by
    <emphasis>reassigning</emphasis> old component names (in the
    Component Names View for example, see the section on reassigning
    component names (<xref linkend="entering-and-reassigning-component-names-in-the-component-names-view"/>).
  </para>
  <para>
    You can create new component names in the Component Names Browser and in the Object Mapping Editor (tree view) via the context menu:
    
    <para>
      <emphasis role="menuPath">New Component Name</emphasis>
    </para>
  </para>
  <para>
    <para role="tip">You can also use the toolbar button to create a new
    component name when you are in the Object Mapping Editor.</para>
  </para>
  <para>
    A dialog will appear to allow you to enter a component name. We
    recommend having good naming conventions for component names, as
    this will help you when mapping later.
  </para>
  <para>
    The component name you enter will be created and will appear in
    the <emphasis>unassigned component names</emphasis> category in
    the Object Mapping Editor and in the <emphasis>unused component
    names</emphasis> category in the Component Names Browser.
  </para>
  <para>
    <para role="tip">Newly created component names have the type
    <emphasis>graphics component</emphasis> until they are made more
    specific, either by mapping them to a technical name or by
    entering this new name in the Component Names View for a more
    concrete component type. </para>
