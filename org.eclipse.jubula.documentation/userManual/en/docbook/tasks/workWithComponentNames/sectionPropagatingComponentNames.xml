  <title>Propagating component names</title>
  <anchor role="helpid" id="compNameViewContextId">Component Names View</anchor>
  <para>
    Select the checkbox on the left of the Component Names View to
    <emphasis>propagate</emphasis> this component name. This means
    that you will be able to see and edit (reassign) this component
    name when you reuse the parent of the Test Case you are editing.
  </para>
  <para>
    This is useful for creating flexible keywords that can be used
    for the same workflow on different components. Depending on what
    you want the keyword to do when you reuse it, you can reassign
    the name to test different components in the AUT.
  </para>
  <para>
    For example, if you create a keyword ”<emphasis>Replace and
    Check</emphasis>” which contains an action to replace a text and
    then check it. If you want to be able to use this keyword to
    enter and check text on any field in your AUT, then you should
    propagate the component names from the actions by checking the
    checkbox in the Component Names View. Each time you reuse
    ”<emphasis>Replace and Check</emphasis>”, then you will be able
    to enter a new name for the propagated component, allowing you
    to choose different names that can be mapped to different
    components.
