  <title>The Dashboard application</title>
  <para>
    The Dashboard is a web application that allows you to view test
    results from within a browser. You can only see test results
    which are still in the database (<xref linkend="re-opening-the-test-result-view-for-a-test-run"/>).
    If you still wish to see test results after a database
    migration, then you should ensure that the old database instance
    and a Dashboard in the correct version remain installed so that
    older test results can be read.
