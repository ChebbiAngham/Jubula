  <title>Starting the Dashboard application in the browser</title>
  <para>
    Once the Dashboard server has been started, you can start the
    Dashboard application in the browser. This happens automatically
    if you are using the <emphasis>dashboard</emphasis> application
    (<xref linkend="starting-dashboard-with-default-parameters"/>),
    or you can enter a URL to start the web application and
    connect to the server you started (<xref linkend="connecting-to-dashboard"/>).
