  <title>Using the Dashboard locally: Starting the Dashboard with
  default parameters and automatic browser opening</title>
  <para>
    Although the Dashboard is primarily intended to be started on a
    central machine with access to a central database in which the
    test results reside, it is also possible to start the Dashboard
    in a default configuration to allow access to the embedded
    database. This option is useful if you are evaluating the
    function and want to use the Dashboard on your local machine
    without having to enter any configuration information.

        Starting this application starts the
        <emphasis>dashboardserver</emphasis> with default parameters
        for the embedded database. You can see which parameters are
        used by looking in the
        <emphasis>dashboardserver.properties</emphasis> file which
        is in the same folder as the Dashboard application.

        While the server is starting, you will see a progress

        Once the server is started, a browser opens containing the
