  <title>Do - While and While - Do loops</title>
  <para>
    These loops are executing the test cases in their Do Container as long as their
    While Condition is true. For Do - While loops the Do Container is executed first
    followed by the While Condition, for While - Do loops the other way around.
  </para>
  <para>
    You can set a Do - While or While - Do loop to be negated in the Properties View of its top node
    (called "Do While" or "While Do" by default). A negated loop executes its Do Container as
    long as its While Condition is false.
  </para>
  <para>
    To avoid infinite loops, all loops automatically stop after a set amount of runs. You can
    change this value in the Test --> Test Results Properties Page. The default value is 100.
    In case a (possibly) infinite loop is encountered, its corresponding Test Result Node is marked
    with an error marker. When executing tests using the <emphasis>testexec</emphasis> client,
    this value can be set by the <emphasis>-itermax</emphasis> command - line option.
