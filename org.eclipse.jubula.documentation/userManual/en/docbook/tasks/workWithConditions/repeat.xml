  <title>Repeat loops</title>
  <para>
    The Do Container is executed as many times as their
    Iterate count parameter indicates. This parameter is evaluated statically when
    execution of the Repeat loop begins, so any changes to this parameter inside the loop
    (e.g. if it uses a variable) does not have any effect on the number of iterations.
  </para>
  <para>
    To avoid infinite loops, all loops automatically stop after a set amount of runs. You can
    change this value in the Test --> Test Results Properties Page. The default value is 100.
    In case a (possibly) infinite loop is encountered, its corresponding Test Result Node is marked
    with an error marker. When executing tests using the <emphasis>testexec</emphasis> client,
    this value can be set by the <emphasis>-itermax</emphasis> command - line option.
