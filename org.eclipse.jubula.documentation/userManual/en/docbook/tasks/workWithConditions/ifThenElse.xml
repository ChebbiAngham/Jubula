  <title>Conditional Statements (If - Then - Else)</title>
  <para>
    Conditional Statements behave as usual: if their Condition does not throw any
    unhandled Check Fail events then their Then Container is executed, otherwise their
    Else Container is executed instantly after the Check Fail event is encountered - so the
    remaining parts of the Conditions are skipped.
  </para>
  <para>
    You can set a Conditional Statement to be Negated in the Properties View of its top node
    (called "If" by default). A Negated Conditional Statement executes its Then Container when
    its Condition fails and its Else Container when it does not.
