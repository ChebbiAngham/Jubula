    <title>TODO Teststyle</title>
    <para>The Todo Testyle is searching for a text in the name of
     nodes in the specified context. It cannot be searched for ”<emphasis>;</emphasis>” since this is used to split into multiple search text.</para>
     <para>If you want to search for multiple texts at the same time you can divide them by using a semicolon ”<emphasis>;</emphasis>”.
      If this is done e.g. ”<emphasis>#TODO;%TODO</emphasis>” for both of the texts is searched.
      That means one of them must exist in the name and a problem will be generated for it so you see it in the problems view.</para>
