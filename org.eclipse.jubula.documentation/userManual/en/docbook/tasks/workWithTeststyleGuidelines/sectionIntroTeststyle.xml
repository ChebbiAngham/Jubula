  <title>Introduction to Teststyle</title>
  <para>
    Teststyle lets you perform static analysis of your tests to make
    sure they conform to conventions and best practices. For any
    guidelines you have set in the Project, Teststyle will inform you
    if they are not being upheld by displaying information, warnings
    and errors in the Problems View. Elements in the Project where
    warnings and errors are present are decorated with the yellow
    warning symbol and the red error cross.
  </para>
  <para>
    The Teststyle guidelines available reflect best practices and
    conventions from working in a variety of Projects. They include
    guidelines on naming conventions to make tests easy to read, easy
    to incorporate into build processes, structural conventions for
    your Projects and test design guidelines to make tests
    maintainable and understandable.
