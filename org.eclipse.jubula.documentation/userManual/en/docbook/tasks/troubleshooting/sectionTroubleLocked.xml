  <title>I canâ€™t save my editor</title>
  <para>
    If you are working in a multi-user environment, or if you are
    working on multiple editors at once, the editors may be locked.
    This is to secure the editors so that conflicting changes do not
    take place. You will be able to save changes in your editor once
    the changes by the other tester or in the other editor have been
    saved.
  </para>
  <para>
    After an irregular shutdown, you may find that some editors may
    still be locked. This is temporary and will pass.
