  <title>My Test Suite failed</title>
  <para>
    If your test fails, you can find exact details about the problem by looking at the Test
    Result View (<xref linkend="testresultview"/>). A screenshot of the AUT is automatically
    taken when an error occurs and can be seen in the Image View.
  </para>
  <para>
    For other problems with test execution, check:

        That the AUT is in focus and is visible. You can
        automatically activate the AUT in the AUT properties
        (<xref linkend="configuringaut"/>) or you can use a Test Case to
        activate the AUT. You can also set your preferences to
        minimize the ITE when test execution begins (<xref linkend="gdprefs"/>).
      </para>
      <para role="warning">
        Bear in mind that different platforms have different
        focus behavior. You may need to specifically bring the AUT
        into focus by clicking into it as a part of the test.

    <listitem>
      <para>
        That the AUT is ready when the test begins. To ensure this,
        you can insert a Test Case at the beginning of each test
        which waits for the window or for the first component you
        want to test. This is especially important when you are
        running tests from the command line with the Test Executor.

      <para role="tip">
        Waiting for a window to appear is generally a good
        idea whenever a new window or dialog is opened during the
        test. Waiting for the window or the component you want to
        test will make sure that your tests run even under different
        timing conditions.

        If the AUT is an RCP application, make sure that the

        Otherwise, make sure you have the current version of the RCP
        Remote Control plugin (start your application with -clean to
        be sure).
