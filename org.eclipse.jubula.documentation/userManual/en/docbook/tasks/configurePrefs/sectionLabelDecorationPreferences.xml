    From this preference page, you can alter your preferences for:
  </para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>
        Completeness Check Decorator:
      </term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
           We recommend leaving this decorator active, as it shows
          you red crosses and tooltips in the Test Suite Browser
          when Test Suites and Test Jobs are incomplete.
        </para>
      </listitem>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>
        Test Result Duration Decorator:
      </term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Deactivate this option to not see the execution time
          required for each node in the Test Result View. The times
          shown are for the execution of each node, including its
          children. You can use this information to see whether
          specific Test Cases are taking longer than you expect them
          to.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>
        Test Result Parameter Decorator:
      </term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Deactivate this option to not see the parameter values
          used at this node (i.e. either entered at this level, or
          actually used at this place) in the Test Result View. You
          can use this information to easily see which data were
          used for your Test Cases, without having to click through
          each individual node in the Test Result View. This can be
          especially useful if you have one Test Case that runs
          multiple times with different datasets.
