  <title>Introduction to Remote Debugging</title>
  <para>
    You can remote debug an AUT by simply modifying or creating a
    AUT configuration. The following options must be added to
    your JRE Arguments:
  </para>
<programlisting>
-Xdebug 
-Xnoagent 
-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=4711 
-Djava.compiler=NONE 
</programlisting>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        The ”suspend=y/n” option determines whether the JVM waits with
        the execution of the program until the debugger has connected
        itself or not.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        The ”address=&lt;portNo&gt;” determines the port the debugger
        has to connect to.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
    <para role="tip">Not all JREs support the arguments listed above. If you are not using a Java Standard Edition JRE to start your AUT, you will likely not be able to use this method to remotely debug your AUT.</para>
