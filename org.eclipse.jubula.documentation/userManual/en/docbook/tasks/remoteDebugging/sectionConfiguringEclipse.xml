  <title>Configuring Eclipse for remote debugging</title>
  <para>
    Create a new <quote>Remote Java Application</quote> in the
    <quote>Launch configuration</quote> dialog and enter the
    hostname for the computer on which the AUT Agent is running.
    The specified port has to be the same which you used in the
    AUT configuration (e.g. 4711).
  </para>
  <para>
    To get your AUT running using remote debugging options you
    have to take the following steps:
  </para>
  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Start the AUT Agent
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Connect the ITE with the AUT Agent, load the
        Project in the ITE and invoke the startup of the
        AUT in the ITE.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        If ”suspend=y”, you now have to run your <quote>Remote Java
        Application</quote>-configuration in Eclipse, as the JVM is
        waiting for the debugger to connect before starting the
        application. As soon as you are connected you should see the
        default debug behaviour in your debug perspective of
        Eclipse.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Your AUT has now been launched with the ability to use
        remote debugging.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>
  <para>
    If you wish to debug an RCP AUT which is launched with an
    executable file, you must pass these JRE arguments via the
    AUT arguments and ”-vmargs”. When using this option, make
    sure you overwrite all JRE options that are defined in the
    ”config.ini” of your RCP launcher.
