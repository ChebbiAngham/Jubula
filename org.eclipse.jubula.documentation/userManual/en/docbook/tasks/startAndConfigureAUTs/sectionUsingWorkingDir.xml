  <title>Using a working directory in an AUT configuration</title>
  <anchor role="helpid" xml:id="autConfigSettingWizardPagePageContextId">Configuring an AUT</anchor>
  <para>
    In some AUT configuration dialogs, you can optionally
    create a working directory to store files in. The server
    directory of the installation is selected as default. To create
    a working directory elsewhere, browse to and select the
    location.
  </para>
  <para>
    The working directory is the root directory for any classpaths,
    classnames, JAR files and binaries. If you create a working
    directory, you can enter the paths to these items using a
    relative path, with the working directory as the root. For more
    information on relative paths, read the section later
    (<xref linkend="using-relative-paths-in-aut-configurations-and-as-test-data"/>).
