    If you are reusing a Project or Projects in your currently
    opened Project (<xref linkend="reuseproject"/>), you can move Test Cases you
    create to these reused Projects to make them a part of that
    Project.

  <para>
    This lets you add useful Test Cases to external libraries to be
    reused in other Projects.

        In the Test Case Browser, select the Test Case, Test Cases

        you are currently reusing in the open Project.

        The structure of your Project stays the same â€“ the moved
        Test Cases are not deleted from places where you have reused
        them, for example.

    If you move Test Cases containing referenced Test Cases
    from other Projects, make sure that the Project the Test Cases
    are dependent on is also reused in your external Project.
