  <title>Information on Test Steps</title>
  <para>
    Test Steps are the smallest unit in a test. They correspond to one
    action on one component.
  </para>
  <para role="tip">
    Instead of creating Test Steps, we recommend using the
    library of Test Cases (<xref linkend="creating-tests-from-the-library-of-pre-defined-test-cases"/>). Each Test Case
    in the library contains one Test Step, with all the parameters
    already referenced. Using the library makes test creation much
    easier!
