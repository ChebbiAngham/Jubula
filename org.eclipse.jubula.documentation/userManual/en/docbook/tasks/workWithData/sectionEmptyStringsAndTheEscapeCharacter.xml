    If you want the parameter you enter to be an <emphasis>empty string</emphasis> (i.e. nothing), use two single quote marks: ”

  <para>
    You can use this with the <emphasis>equals</emphasis>, <emphasis>matches</emphasis> or
    <emphasis>simple match</emphasis> operators.

  <para>
    You can also use ’<literal>^$</literal>’ or
    ’<literal>^\s*$</literal>’ with the operator <emphasis>matches</emphasis> to
    check that a text area is empty.

    <emphasis role="strong">The escape character</emphasis><?linebreak?>
    Some symbols have a special meaning for test execution. If you want to use the symbol without the special function, you have to <emphasis>escape</emphasis> it. The symbol to negate any special function of the following symbol is a backslash: (∖).

    details on special symbols and escaping them.

    <para role="tip">When you are using regular expressions, you will also need to think about which symbols need neutralising. Sometimes more than one backslash is necessary.</para>
