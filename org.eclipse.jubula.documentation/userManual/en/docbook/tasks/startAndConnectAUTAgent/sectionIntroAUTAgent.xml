    The AUT Agent is the server component. It runs on the same machine
    as the AUT and allows the ITE to communicate with the AUT and
    control it during test execution. You must be connected to a
    running AUT Agent in order to be able to perform object mapping,
    to observe tests, and to execute tests.

  <para>
    There are two options for working with an AUT Agent:

        You can connect to an embedded AUT Agent that does not have to
        be started in advance (<xref linkend="connect-aut-agent"/>). This option
        is only available if you are starting your AUT on the same
        machine as the ITE. It can also be used with the test
        executor: the testexec can start an embedded AUT Agent for use
        during the test.

        You can start an AUT Agent on a machine (local or remote) and
        connect to it using the ITE or the Test Executor
        (<xref linkend="start-aut-agent"/>).
