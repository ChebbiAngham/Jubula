  <title>Combining Test Suites into a Test Job</title>
  <anchor role="helpid" xml:id="testExecViewContextId">Test Suite Browser</anchor>
  <para>
    You can create a Test Job when you want to execute a collection
    of Test Suites after each other.
  </para>
  <para>
    The Test Suites can test different instances of the same AUT, or
    different AUTs entirely.
  </para>
  <para>
    You do not have to create a Test Job if you only want to run
    tests on one instance of one AUT. To do this, you can use a Test
    Suite (<xref linkend="working-with-suites"/>). A Test Job is most useful when
    you want to switch between two AUTs (either the same AUT or a
    different one) in one test run.
