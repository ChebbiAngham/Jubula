  <title>Copy and paste items in editors</title>
  <para>
    You can copy one or multiple items (Test Cases, Test Steps Test Suites, Event Handlers) from within editors and paste them into the same editor or another editor.
  </para>
    <para>
        Copy and Paste has some restrictions:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Copying items can only be performed from non-dirty (i.e. saved) editors:
                save your editor before copying items.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The clipboard of the ITE will be cleared when a project is opened or
                    refreshed, and when a copied item is deleted</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Performing refactor actions will also clean the ITE clipboard
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Event Handlers can only be copied from the Event Handler area
                    to the Event Handler area</para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
        You can use the context menu entries to copy and paste items, or you can
        use the standard platform key combinations to copy and paste.
    </para>
    <para>
        If you require the same items in the same order multiple times, it
        might be worth creating a reusable module using, e.g. the 
        <link linkend="extracting-test-cases-from-editors-refactoring">Extract Test Case</link>
        function. This will make test maintenance easier.
