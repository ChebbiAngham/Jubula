    <para>
    Using Object Mapping Category association will reduce the proposed component 
    names for the Component Names View to only the restricted Object Mapping categories and their children.
    
    This is only working for all the children of a test case.
  </para>
  <para>
   There are two ways to assign Object Mapping Categories to a test case.
   Either in the Test Case Browser select a test case from the project and 
   select <emphasis>Edit OM association</emphasis> in the context menu.
   You can also do the same within the Test Case Editor when selecting the root node.
  </para>
  <para>
   The Dialog which is opening is having one combobox and two trees with buttons between them.
   The Combobox shows which AUT is used for using the categories.
   Only one AUT can be selected at any time, if it is switched to another AUT all selected Categories will be removed.
   The left tree shows the available categories and the
   right shows the categories which are already selected.
   You can move the categories between  both trees with the buttons between them.
