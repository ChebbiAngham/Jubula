  <title>Introduction to the dbtool client</title>
  <para>
    You can use the dbtool to import, export and delete Projects from
    the database in without using the ITE. You can also use it to
    create a new version of a Project in the database.
  </para>
  <para>
    This is particularly useful for automated build and test
    processes, where you may want to automatically export and import
    Projects out of and into version control to run your tests.
