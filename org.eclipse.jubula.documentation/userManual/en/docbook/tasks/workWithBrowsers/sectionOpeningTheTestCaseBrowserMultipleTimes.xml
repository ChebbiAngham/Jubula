  <para>
    To make navigation in larger Projects easier, you can open
    multiple instances of the Test Case Browser. You can filter each
    Test Case Browser separately to give you different views of your
    Test Cases at the same time. All instances of the Test Case
    Browser are kept up-to-date with any changes to Test Cases in
    the Project.

        To open a new Test Case Browser, select <emphasis>New Test
        Case Browser</emphasis> from the small arrow menu in the
        Test Case Browser. A new Test Case Browser will open.

        When you have multiple browsers open, one of them will
        always be marked as the main browser in its title. This is
        the default browser for actions such as ”<emphasis>Show
        Specification</emphasis>” and for the displaying of any
        search results. You can switch the main browser using the
        button in the toolbar. If you close the Test Case Browser
        you have marked as being the main browser, another Test Case
        Browser will automatically be marked as the new main
        browser.
