    Once you have collected the components from the AUT that you will use during the test
    (<xref linkend="collecting-components-technical-names-from-the-aut"/>), you can then map them to the component
    names you used in your Test Cases.

        In the Object Mapping Editor, you will see the component names
        you have created (<xref linkend="creating-new-component-names"/>) and/or used
        in your Test Cases, as well as the names you have collected
        from the AUT. The names are shown in the 
        unassigned and assigned names areas (<xref linkend="working-with-categories-in-the-object-mapping-editor"/>).

        To map a component name to a technical name, you must drag
        the <emphasis>unassigned component name</emphasis> onto the
        corresponding <emphasis>unassigned technical name</emphasis>
        that you want this component name to refer to.

        When a component name has been assigned to a technical name,
        the joined names appear in the <emphasis>assigned
        names</emphasis> area. The component type for the
        component name is adjusted so that it reflects the type of
        component it has been mapped to (<xref linkend="understanding-the-component-hierarchy"/>).

        You can also ”unassign” component names from
        technical names by dragging the component name back into the
