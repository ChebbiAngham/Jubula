  <title>Viewing properties for a component in the Object Mapping Mode</title>
  <anchor role="helpid" xml:id="objectMapEditorContextId">Object Mapping</anchor>
  <para>
    When you collect a component from a Swing, SWT/RCP or JavaFX AUT
    in the Object Mapping Mode (<xref linkend="collecting-components-technical-names-from-the-aut"/>), you can see
    additional information on the properties for that component in
    the Properties View.
  </para>
  <para>
    The property information shows you which properties the
    component has, and their values. If a property is not
    accessible, you will see a notice informing you of this.
  </para>
  <para>
    You can use this information to help you write tests that use
    the actions <emphasis>check property</emphasis> and
    <emphasis>store property</emphasis>.
  </para>
  <para>
    The property information is not saved when the Object Mapping
    Editor is saved: to view property information again, you must
    collect the component in the Object Mapping Mode again.
  </para>
  <para role="tip">
    Property information can be transient, i.e. it can change
    as the component or AUT changes. To make sure that you collect
    the right property, collect the component when it is in the
    state that you want it to have. A simple example is the color of
    a component: if you have a component can be green or red and you
    want to check that it is red, then you should collect it while
    it is red to see the correct property.
