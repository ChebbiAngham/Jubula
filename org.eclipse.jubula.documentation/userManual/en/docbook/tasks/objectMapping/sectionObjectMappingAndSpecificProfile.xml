	<para>
	You can set specific profiles for the object recognition for individual
	components. This might be useful for components which can't be found
	with the standard profile. 
    </para>
	<para>
		To give you an example: A button might be used in different
		dialogs and even though you've given the button a name it can not be
		found reliably. The reason for this is that the other parameters
		(hierarchy, context), which are used in the heuristic, are different
		for each dialog. Therefore it would be a good idea to only take the name
		into account for the lookup. Thus you should use the profile
		<emphasis>Given Names</emphasis>.
		You can change this for all components as described here
		<xref linkend="the-configuration-view-in-the-object-mapping-editor" />
		. But this might not be a good idea when not every component in your AUT
		has a unique name. Therefore you should change the profile only for
		this component.
