    You can automatically update tasks in an external repository when a test has run. 
    You can report the test results by writing a comment on a task in the external repository 
    with a link to the test result in the dasboard. 
    You can also update fields / attributes on tasks based on information 
    you specify in your Project.

          When you select this option, the reporting will be
          triggered as described above. If the reporting is
          successful, the status in the <emphasis>ALM Report
          Status</emphasis> column changes from <emphasis>Not yet
          reported</emphasis> to <emphasis>Reported</emphasis>. If
          an error occurs, then the status remains as <emphasis>Not

          If you do not want to report the test results to an ALM
          tool, you can discard the reporting information by
          selecting the option to discard a pending report from the
          context menu. This changes the status in the <emphasis>ALM
          Report Status</emphasis> column from <emphasis>Not yet
          reported</emphasis> to <emphasis>Report
          discarded</emphasis>.

          To use the HP ALM integration, you must use a separate
          connector for HP ALM which may incur license costs. Visit
          the Tasktop website for more details

          If you have changed the attribute IDs in your HP ALM installation for defects and / or requirements from their relative defaults (<emphasis>BG_DEV_COMMENTS</emphasis> and <emphasis>REQ_DEV_COMMENTS</emphasis>), or if you have changed the ID for the connector, then you must modify these properties in the <emphasis role="input">almAccess.properties</emphasis> file contained in the jar:

          Since tasks in HP ALM only have one comment field, the
          result information is appended to the comment field
          instead of being added as a new comment each time.

          To write to requirements in a default HP ALM installation,
          you must use the prefix <emphasis>REQ</emphasis>, e.g.
          REQ100. To write to defects in a default HP ALM
          installation, you must use the prefix
          <emphasis>DEF</emphasis>, e.g. DEF42.
