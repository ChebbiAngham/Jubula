  <title>Numeric Project Element Counter</title>
  <para>
    This metric is in the category <emphasis>Numerical
    Metrics</emphasis>.
  </para>
  <para>
    This metric counts the amount of items in a Project according to
    the following rules:
  </para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>
        Test Cases:
      </term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          How many individual Test Cases have been created.
        </para>
      </listitem>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>
        Test Suites:
      </term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          How many individual Test Suites have been created.
        </para>
      </listitem>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>
        Test Jobs:
      </term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          How many individual Test Jobs have been created.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>
        Test Steps:
      </term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          How many individual Test Steps have been created, plus how
          many Test Steps have been used from any reused Projects.
          Test Steps are only counted once for the place they are
          specified (or, in the case of Test Steps from reused
          Projects, reused). They are not counted transitively (i.e.
          if a Project contains a Test Case with one Test Step, and
          this Test Case is reused four times, there is still only
          one Test Step.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>
        Referenced Test Cases:
      </term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          How many separate (not transitive) Test Case references
          there are in the current scope. If a Test Case
          <emphasis>TC1</emphasis> is reused twice in a Test Case
          <emphasis>TC2</emphasis>, then the number of reuses for
          <emphasis>TC1</emphasis> is two, regardless of how many
          times <emphasis>TC2</emphasis> is reused.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>
        Event Handlers:
      </term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          How many Event Handlers are used in the current scope. The
          same rules for non-transitivity apply - if
          <emphasis>TC1</emphasis> contains an Event Handler, then
          this Event Handler is only counted once, regardless how
          many times <emphasis>TC1</emphasis> is reused.
        </para>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>
        Categories:
      </term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          How many categories are created in the current scope. Only
          categories in the Test Case Browser and Test Suite Browser
          are currently counted.
