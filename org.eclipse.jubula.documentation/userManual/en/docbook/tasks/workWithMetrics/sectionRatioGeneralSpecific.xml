  <title>Ratio general : specific</title>
  <para>
    This metric is in the category <emphasis>Numerical
    Metrics</emphasis>.
  </para>
  <para>
    This metric calculates the amount of Test Cases or Test Steps
    used that are generally available for all
    <emphasis>toolkits</emphasis> (the
    ”<emphasis>concrete</emphasis>” actions). It then counts the
    amount of actions used that are specific to one or more
    particular toolkits (e.g. specific to the RCP toolkit or the
    HTML toolkit). The results are presented as percentages in the
    Search Result View.
  </para>
  <para>
    Wherever possible, it is preferable to work with more general
    actions than specific. This metric may help you to gauge how
    well you are keeping to this guideline.
