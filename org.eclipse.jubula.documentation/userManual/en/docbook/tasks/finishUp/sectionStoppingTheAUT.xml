        To stop the AUT manually, select the AUT you want to stop

    <emphasis role="strong">Stopping an AUT in a test</emphasis><?linebreak?>
    Stopping an AUT as part of a test is generally not possible. The AUT will be stopped automatically at the end of testing according to the points mentioned above.
  </para>
  <para>
    You can use the <emphasis>restart</emphasis> action to restart
    the AUT during the test. You may be able to use the action
    <emphasis>External Key Combination</emphasis> to send an
    unconfirmed keystroke to the AUT (i.e.
    <emphasis role="input">»ENTER«</emphasis> on a prompt dialog for
    closing the AUT) to close the AUT at the end of your test,
    however, the success of this is dependent on the AUT and
    environment as well as timing and synchronization issues.
