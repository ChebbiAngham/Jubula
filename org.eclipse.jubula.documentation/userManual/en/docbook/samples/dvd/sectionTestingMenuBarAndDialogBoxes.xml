  <title>Sample 2.1: testing the menu bar and dialog boxes</title>
  <para>
    This category and the ones following it contain Test Cases which
    are used in the executable Test Case
    <emphasis>2_DVD_TOOL_FULL_TEST</emphasis> and the Test Suite of
    the same name.
  </para>
  <para>
    The Test Case in this category contains a reused Test Case from
    the <emphasis>bound_modules_samples</emphasis> Project. It
    contains Test Cases to add a category to the DVD Tool via the
    menu. The parameter for the category name has been referenced,
    as has a variable to read the category name entered for use
    later in the test.
  </para>
  <para>
    The original Test Case in the
    <emphasis>bound_modules_samples</emphasis> Project had no data.
    When it was reused here, three data sets were added. This means
    that the Test Case is executed three times, each time entering a
    different category name, and storing the name as a variable.
