  <para>
    The Component Names View is in the lower right-hand corner of the
    Functional Test Specification Perspective by default, just behind the Data Sets
    View. It lets you see the component names used in a reused Test
    Case, and add more component names. This means that you can use
    a Test Case to execute the same actions on different components.
