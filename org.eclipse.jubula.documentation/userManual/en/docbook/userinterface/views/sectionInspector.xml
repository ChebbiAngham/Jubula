  <title>The Inspector View</title>
  <para>
    The Inspector View can be used to help you test RCP AUTs which use
    the GEF framework. When the inspector is activated, figures can
    be clicked in the GEF canvas, and their textpath (used to
    identify them in the test) is shown. The Inspector View is shown by
    default in the bottom right-hand corner of the Functional Test Specification
    Perspective.
