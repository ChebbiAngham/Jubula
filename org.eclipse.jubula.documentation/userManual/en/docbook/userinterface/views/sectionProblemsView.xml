  <para>
    The Problem View is by default at the bottom of the Functional Test
    Specification Perspective, under the editor area. The Properties View
    helps you to work with the ITE by giving you information, warnings and errors.
    Double-clicking on a message will either carry out the necessary
    action or open a dialog/editor to sort out the problem, if this
    is possible.
