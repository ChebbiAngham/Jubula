  <para>
    The Test Result View is in the middle of the Execution
    Perspective by default. It can also be displayed in the bottom
    right-hand corner of the Functional Test Specification Perspective via the
    preferences. It follows and displays the results of the test
    execution. Each Test Step and Test Case is marked with a green
    tick or a red cross depending on if it passed or failed.

    If you select an item in the Test Result View, you can see its
    details in the Properties View. If the Project is open and the
    item is still available, you can double-click on a Test Step or
    Test Case in the Test Result View, to highlight it in the Test
    Suite Browser. Double-clicking on this item in the Test Suite
    Browser will open the editor for this item in the Functional Test Specification
    Perspective.
