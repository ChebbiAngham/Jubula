    You can write extensions for various parts of the tool.

    There is a simple way to extend your Jubula ITE to add support for a previously
    unsupported component on a <emphasis>graphics component</emphasis> level, e.g.
    if you only want to execute a click on that component. All you have to do is
    to add <emphasis>"SimpleExtenions"</emphasis> as a key to the property map of an
    AUT and a comma-separated list of fully qualified classnames as the value
    (<xref linkend="define-aut"/>).
  </para>
  <para>
    Such a component has to meet some requirements depending on its toolkit.
