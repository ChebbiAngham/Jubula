  <title>Technical names</title>
  <para>
    You do not need to consult the developers to collect technical
    names; you use the running AUT to collect the names. If the
    developers have named the components, this name will be
    collected. If the developers have not named the component, a
    name is generated.
  </para>
  <para>
    <para role="tip">In the mapping mode, high-level components are usually
    addressed. You will not be able to map individual menu entries
    or tree nodes on desktop applications, for example. Instead, you
    map the tree component, and specify which entry/node to
    select/check as a parameter for the action. </para>
