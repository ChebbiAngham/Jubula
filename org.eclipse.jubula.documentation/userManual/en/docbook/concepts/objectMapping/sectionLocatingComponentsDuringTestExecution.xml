  <title>Locating components during test execution</title>
  <para>
    The component recognition system uses various details about
    mapped components to find the right component during the test.
    The location of the component in the AUT hierarchy, the
    components near to it and the name of the component all play a
    role in component recognition. For each possible component, the
    similarity to the originally mapped component is calculated. The
    component with the highest result is selected.
  </para>
  <para>
    This method makes object mapping generally resilient to changes
    in the AUT.
