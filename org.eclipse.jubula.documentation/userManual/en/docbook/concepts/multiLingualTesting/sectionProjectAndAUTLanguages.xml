  <title>Project and AUT languages</title>
  <para>
    You can test different language versions of your AUT with the
    same test. All you have to do is translate the data for the
    test.
  </para>
  <para>
    To make multilingual testing possible, you have specify which
    languages you are using:
  </para>
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>
        Project language(s):
      </term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          These languages are specified during Project creation and
          are valid for all AUTs in this Project. You will be able
          to have AUTs which support one or more of these languages.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>
        Default language:
      </term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          One of the Project languages is the default language. This
          is the language which will automatically be set as the
          working language when you open the Project. 
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>
        AUT language(s):
      </term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          When you are defining an AUT, you choose one or more AUT
          languages from the selection of Project languages. These
          languages are the languages the AUT supports. You can
          start the AUT in these languages and write test data for
          these languages. 
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>
        The working language:
      </term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          In the toolbar in the ITE, you can change the working
          language to any of the Project languages. The working
          language determines which Test Suites you can edit (only
          those whose AUT supports this language) and the language
          the AUT is started in.
