  <title>Test Suites</title>
  <para>
    Test Suites are the containers for Test Cases to be executed and
    can contain as many Test Cases as necessary. Each Test Suite
    must be bound to one AUT which it will test. An AUT can be bound
    to more than one Test Suite.

  <para>
    An important concept for testing is the ability to test a
    program modularly. Program parts can be tested as and when they
    are delivered using the specific Test Suites for each part. Only
    the chosen Test Suite in a project will be executed, which means
    that testing can begin whether all program components are
    available/functional or not.
