  <title>Introduction to the test hierarchy</title>
  <para>
    The following sections describe the test hierarchy in the ITE.
    Basically, you can think of the test hierarchy as a tree structure
    which can be of any size, complexity and depth
    (<xref linkend="treestructure"/>).

    make changes and keep the test in touch with current software
    development.
