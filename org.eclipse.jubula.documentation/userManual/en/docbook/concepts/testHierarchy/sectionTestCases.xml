  <title>Test Cases</title>
  <para>
    Test Cases are a level up from Test Steps in the test hierarchy.
    They are the building blocks or keywords from which other Test
    Cases and Test Suites are made. They are the reusable elements
    of your tests.
  </para>
  <para>
    A Test Case can contain any number of Test Steps and other Test
    Cases nested to any depth. Test Cases are given user-defined
    names.
  </para>
  <para>
    Test Cases can be reused â€“ in other Test Cases and in Test
    Suites. There are no limits on how often a Test Case can be
    reused, as long as no circular dependencies (infinite loops) are
    created.
