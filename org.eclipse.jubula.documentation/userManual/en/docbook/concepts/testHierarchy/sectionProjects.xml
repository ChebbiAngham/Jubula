  <title>Projects</title>
  <para>
    Tests are organized into Projects. A Project is the top-level
    container. Projects contain runnable tests and the details about
    the AUTs to be tested (how to start them, in which language
    etc.).
  </para>
  <para>
    You can work jointly on Projects using the multi-user database,
    and you can also share Projects using the import and export
    functions.
