  <title>Test Jobs</title>
  <para>
    Test Jobs are the containers for Test Suites which are to be
    executed in a sequence. A Test Job can contain Test Suites which
    test different AUTs or different instances of the same AUT (with
    some restrictions, see the previous
    <xref linkend="testing-different-auts-in-one-test-run"/> for details). Each Test Suite in a Test
    Job is bound to an AUT and specifies which AUT it will test
    based on the AUT ID.
