  <title>Default Event Handlers</title>
  <para>
    Default Event Handlers are a part of the Test Suite and can be
    considered as being present at the Test Suite level. They are
    activated when no Event Handler has been found for the event
    type in the part of the tree where the error occurred. The
    default reentry type for each event type can be specified in the
    Properties View for the Test Suite Editor.
  </para>
  <para>
    The reentry types for the default Event Handlers are the same
    throughout the tree. Everywhere a certain type of error occurs,
    the same action will be taken, unless the part of the tree where
    the error occurred has its own Event Handler for that event
    type.
