  <title>Customized Event Handlers</title>
  <para>
    Customized Event Handlers are essentially Test Cases, and can be
    empty or contain other Test Steps/Test Cases. They can be used
    to specify particular behavior in case of an error in one part
    of the test tree, or they can be placed so as to affect how the
    test continues. If an Event Handler contains Test Steps/Test
    Cases, the specified reentry will happen when the Event Handler
    has been executed.
  </para>
  <para>
    Customized Event Handlers are valid for all Test Cases under the
    Test Case where the Event Handler is nested, unless one of these
    child Test Cases has an Event Handler of its own for this error
    type.
