  <title>Event Handlers</title>
  <para>
    Event Handlers are a way of reacting to errors during test
    execution and to continue the test in a way you define.

    is a Test Case used with a special function. It is only
    executed when a certain type of error occurs. There are four
    different types of error, and each Test Case can have an Event
    Handler for each error type. You can specify different reactions
    to each different error type, so that serious errors can stop the
    test, but unimportant errors will not affect the execution.
  </para>
  <para>
    Because Event Handlers are normal Test Cases, they can also
    contain Event Handlers, can do any of the things that a normal
    Test Case can do. The only restriction is that you cannot add a
    Test Case to itself as an Event Handler.
