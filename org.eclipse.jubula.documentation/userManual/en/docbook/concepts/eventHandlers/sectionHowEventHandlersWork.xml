  <title>How Event Handlers work</title>
  <para>
    When an error occurs in a Test Step, its parent Test Case is
    searched for an Event Handler for this type of error. If no
    Event Handler is found, the parent Test Case of this Test Case
    is searched and so on. Once a corresponding Event Handler is
    found, it is activated.
  </para>
  <para>
    If no Event Handler is found in the highest Test Case in this
    part of the tree, a default Event Handler (set in the Test Suite
    properties) is activated.
  </para>
  <para>
    Each Event Handler requires an ”<emphasis>Event Type</emphasis>”
    and a ”<emphasis>Reentry Type</emphasis>”. For information on
    these terms, see the section in the Tasks chapter
    (<xref linkend="dealing-with-errors-in-tests"/>).
