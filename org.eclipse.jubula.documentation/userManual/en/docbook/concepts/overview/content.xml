    With the ITE, you can specify, modify, execute and analyse tests.
    The user interface offers various ways of working, so that you can
    choose the way that suits you best. You can alter the way the
    client looks, and the way it behaves. You can work using the menu
    bar, the tool bar, context-sensitive menus and shortcuts.
