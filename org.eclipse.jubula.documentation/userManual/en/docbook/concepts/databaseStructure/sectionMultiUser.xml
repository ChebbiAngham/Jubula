  <title>Multi-user</title>
  <para>
    When using a multi-user database, multiple testers can work on a
    single Project concurrently.
  </para>
  <para>
    Within such a scenario, all testers currently working on a
    Project may view and execute all parts of it. As soon as one
    tester alters a part of the Project, a lock is placed on that
    unit to disallow other users from making changes of their own.
    They are, however, still able to view and execute a locked test
    unit. Once the user with the lock has saved all changes, the
    lock is removed, and the test unit is once again available for
    editing.
  </para>
  <para>
    This database scenario is well-suited for larger testing
    operations, allowing for tight collaboration among testers and
    reducing the overall time needed to specify complex testing
    projects.
