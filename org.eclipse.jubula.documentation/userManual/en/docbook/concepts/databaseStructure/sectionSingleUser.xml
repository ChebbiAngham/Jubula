  <para>
    If you work on a single-user database, only one tester can work
    on a specific Project at a time. This also applies to the test
    executor â€“ the ITE and the test executor cannot access a
    single-user database at the same time.

    This method reduces the complexity of the system and its
    configuration, and should really only be used for demo purposes.
    Project sharing remains possible, however, through
    import/export.
