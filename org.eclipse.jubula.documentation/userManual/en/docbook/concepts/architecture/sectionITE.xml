  <para>
    The ITE is the interface between you and the AUT. It provides you with browsers
    to see Test Cases and Test Suites, and editors to modify them.
  </para>
  <para>
    In the client, you specify your tests without any programming.
    You can write tests modularly, structure them to fit your needs,
    and easily change them to follow developments in the AUT.
