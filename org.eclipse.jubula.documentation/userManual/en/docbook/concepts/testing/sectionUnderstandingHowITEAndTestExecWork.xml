  <title>Understanding how the ITE and test execution work</title>
  <section id="actions">
    <title>Actions</title>
    <para>
      For test execution, we support ”high-level” actions. By this
      we mean that some of the actions which can be chosen for a
      component actually carry out a number of actions. This makes
      the creation of Test Cases easier and quicker, and makes them
      more understandable.
    </para>
    <para>
      For example, there are two actions to enter text into a text
      field. The action <emphasis>Replace Text</emphasis> selects
      the whole text in the component and then enters the text
      input. This effectively overwrites any text which was already
      in the component. The <emphasis>Input Text</emphasis> action
      clicks once in the component and then enters the text, which
      means that any text previously in the component remains.
    </para>
    <para>
      Another example is the selection and navigation through trees
      and menus. Like a human tester, the test execution works using
      the path to the item to select, and doesn’t first have to
      select the individual sub-items in the path.
    </para>
    <para>
      High-level actions can be used on all standard components
      without problems. However, if the behaviour or look-and-feel
      or a component has been changed (e.g. double-click in a text
      field brings up a dialog instead of selecting the word) then
      some high-level actions may not work. In this case you will
      have to combine the low-level actions. Often, there are many
      ways of achieving the same effect in your test, and it may
      just be a case of trying out a few different ones to see which
      works for you and your AUT.
    </para>
    <para>
      When writing tests, it helps to be aware of things that a
      human tester does implicitly. Often, these are things that
      have to be explicitly stated in an automated test, like
      waiting for the application to be ready, or selecting an item
      before opening the context menu, or even pressing enter to
      close a cell editor in a table.
    </para>

  <section id="test-execution">
    <title>Test execution</title>
    <para>
      Tests are generally execute by sending real clicks and key
      presses, in the same way that a manual tester would. This
      means that a test will give you the same results as a manual
      test – if a menu is disabled, an item can’t be selected and so
      on.
    </para>
    <para>
      Once clicks and key presses have been sent, we wait for
      confirmation from the AUT that they have arrived (manual
      testers use their eyes, we use confirmers).
    </para>
    <para>
      If the AUT or the components in it need to be scrolled to
      access the area being tested, scrolling happens automatically.
      In the same way, if a tree is collapsed, you do not need to
      specify an expand action before selecting a node. The
      expansion is done as part of the selection.
