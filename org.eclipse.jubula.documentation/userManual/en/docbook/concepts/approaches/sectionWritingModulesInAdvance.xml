  <title>Writing modules in advance</title>
  <para>
    If you can identify which reusable modules a test will require
    in advance, then you can specify them in a general or abstract
    way, making them easy to adapt and reuse.
  </para>
  <para>
    These small units are used to construct other modules or
    building blocks, which are more adapted to the task at hand.
    Concrete details can be added as needed.
  </para>
  <para>
    One of the advantages of this approach is that tests are
    flexible and easy to maintain, since a change made at a central
    point can update many places where that Test Case has been
    reused. Tests are also generally more efficient, because time is
    not wasted specifying what is essentially the same Test Case
    over and over again.
  </para>
  <para>
    The difficulty with this approach testing is that it requires a
    good knowledge of the structure of the test â€“ you have to know
    which Test Cases are going to be required multiple times, and
    this is often not easy to recognize at the beginning of testing.
