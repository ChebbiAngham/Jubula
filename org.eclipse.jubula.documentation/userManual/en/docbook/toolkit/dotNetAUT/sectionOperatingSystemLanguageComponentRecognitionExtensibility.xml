  <title>Operating system language, component recognition and
  extensibility</title>
  <para>
    The UI automation framework does not provide
    language-independent component types for component recognition.
    As this would have otherwise lead to language-dependent mapping,
    we have implemented an internal map from the component type ID
    to our own designation of the component type. This makes object
    mapping language-independent, but means that the Windows toolkit
    cannot currently be extended to add support for new components.
