        We have performed our WinForms and WPF tests with an AUT in
        .NET version 4.0. Although tests may be also be executable
        with .NET 3.5 (or even lower), the minimum supported version
        is .NET 4.0.

      <para role="warning">
        The support for WPF AUTs is currently
        experimental. We encourage you to test the support with your
        own AUTs and welcome feedback about the current support.

        AUTs that are not written with WinForms or WPF (e.g. Win32,
        etc.) are not supported in the current version.
