    <title>Supported and unsupported components</title>
    <para>
      Our regression tests are performed on a variety of components,
      including (but not limited to): buttons (push, checkbox,
      radio), textfields, trees, tables, menus, context menus,
      lists, combo boxes and tabbed panes.

          <para>
            Our actions have been written for and tested on tables
            of type System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView. Since the
            introduction of this component in .NET 2.0, the older
            System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid is no longer recommended.
            System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid tables are not supported.

    <para>
      Most of the actions that are available in the
      <emphasis>concrete</emphasis> toolkit have been implemented
      for Windows AUTs. These include, but are not limited to:
      clicking, checking, entering text and selecting.

          Using row headers for table selection:
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Unlike other supported toolkits, Windows AUTs have
            integrated row headers in tables. These are not yet
            supported. When using the actions <emphasis>Select Value
            from Row</emphasis> and <emphasis>Select
            Cell</emphasis>, the row can therefore only be selected
            using its index. It is not possible to enter the value
            in the first column to identify the row as is the case
            in other toolkits.

          Combo box: Check selection of entry by index:
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            This action will not be implemented for Windows AUTs, as
            the dropdown list needs to be opened to access the list
            items. If text is already in the text field of the combo
            box when it is opened, then the first item that matches
            the entered text is selected â€“ this may change the
            selected item and therefore the index.

          Combo box: Relative selection:
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            For the same reason as above, only the value
            <emphasis>absolute</emphasis> is supported for
            selections by value from the combo box.

          Trees: Multiselection:
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            As WinForms does not support true multiselection for
            Trees, any actions used to test the multiselection of a
            Tree will fail.

          <para>
            The actions for check editability on a whole table, or
            on individual cells within it, are not supported in the
            current version.

          Checking the text of password fields:
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The contents of password fields cannot be checked in
            tests for Windows AUTs, as the Windows RC does not run
            in the same process as the AUT itself. Such checks on
            password fields will always fail with a Check Failed
            error.
