  <title>Introduction to writing tests for GEF AUTs</title>
  <para>
    You can write tests for JavaFX AUTs when you select the
    toolkit <emphasis>concrete</emphasis> or <emphasis>JavaFX</emphasis> in the Project
    properties. The JavaFX and concrete toolkits actually contain the
    same actions as each other.
  </para>
  <para>
    When you select JavaFX as the Project toolkit, the library
    Project <emphasis>unbound_modules_concrete</emphasis> is automatically
    reused in your Project. The actions in this library are
    described in the reference manual.
