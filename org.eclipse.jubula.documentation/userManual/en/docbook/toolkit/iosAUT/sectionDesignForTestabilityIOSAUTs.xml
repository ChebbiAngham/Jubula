    <title>Naming components</title>
    <para>
      To be able to robustly test iOS AUTs, we highly recommend
      naming the components in your AUT. The name that is used as a
      part of the object recognition is the <emphasis>accessibility
      identifier</emphasis>. This is a variable that can be
      specified for each UI component in an iOS AUT. It is
      language-independent and is designed for use in automated
      tests. We recommend using unique names throughout the AUT.

    <title>Adding support for text retrieval</title>
    <para>
      If you use custom UI views and cannot access the text
      contained in them during a test, then you can implement the
      UITestable protocol, which provides a method allowing the
      remote control to read the text from such controls.
