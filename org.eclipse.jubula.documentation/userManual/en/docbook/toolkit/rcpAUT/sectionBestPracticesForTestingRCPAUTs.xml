  <title>Best practices for testing RCP AUTs</title>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="strong">Perspective layout reset</emphasis><?linebreak?>
    One of the features of RCP AUTs is that they generally remember the state of the AUT (position of views, which perspective was open) when the AUT is closed. In order to make tests as robust as possible, we recommend starting each use case with a module to reset the perspective to its defaults, and testing with this default perspective.

  <para>
    <emphasis role="strong">Workspace choice</emphasis><?linebreak?>
    RCP AUTs use a workspace to save user-specific preferences. The choice of workspace is usually offered before the AUT starts. This dialog is not currently testable, so we recommend adding the desired workspace as an AUT argument in the AUT configuration (<xref linkend="configuringaut"/>). The parameter used to specify the workspace is <emphasis role="input">-data ''WORKSPACE''</emphasis>.
