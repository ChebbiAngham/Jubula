  <para>
    RCP AUTs often use wizards and standard dialogs. The components
    in these dialogs are not often named by developers, and are in
    different places on Windows, Linux and Mac systems.

  <para>
    You can decide if unique names should be generated for these
    components in your AUT, if no name has been given. You can
    configure this in the AUT settings (<xref linkend="define-aut"/>). We
    recommend selecting this option, as it makes your tests more
    robust to any changes and also makes platform-independent
    testing possible in RCP AUTs.
