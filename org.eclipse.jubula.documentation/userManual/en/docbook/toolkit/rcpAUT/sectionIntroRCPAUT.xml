  <title>Introduction to writing tests for RCP AUTs</title>
  <para>
    You can write tests for RCP AUTs by selecting the toolkit
    <emphasis>concrete</emphasis> or <emphasis>RCP</emphasis> from the Project
    properties. If you will need to test RCP-specific components (such
    as toolbars with drop-down menus, or tree-tables), you will need
    to select <emphasis>RCP</emphasis> as the toolkit for the Project.
  </para>
  <para>
    When you select RCP as the Project toolkit, the library
    Projects <emphasis>unbound_modules_concrete</emphasis>,
    <emphasis>unbound_modules_swt</emphasis> and <emphasis>unbound_modules_rcp</emphasis>
    are automatically reused in your Project. The actions in
    these libraries are described in the reference manual.
  </para>
  <para>
    <para role="tip">The GEF toolkit is a subset of the <emphasis>RCP</emphasis> toolkit and is described in a later <xref linkend="geftest"/>. </para>
