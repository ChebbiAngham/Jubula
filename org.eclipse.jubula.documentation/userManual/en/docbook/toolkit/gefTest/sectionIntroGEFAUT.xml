  <title>Introduction to writing tests for GEF AUTs</title>
  <para>
    The GEF toolkit is a sub-toolkit of RCP. To be able to test AUTs
    that contain GEF components, you must select
    <emphasis>RCP</emphasis> as the toolkit in the Project properties.
  </para>
  <para>
    The same points about the RCP Remote Control plugin and the
    keyboard files mentioned in the section on RCP AUTs (<xref linkend="rcpaut"/>)
    are also valid for testing AUTs with GEF components.
  </para>
  <para>
    Testing GEF components is a little different to testing other
    components, because we highly recommend that the software
    developers use our accessibility plug-in in the AUT to make the
    testing of GEF components more robust.
  </para>
  <para role="tip">
    GEF testing is supported from GEF version 3.0 up to but not
    including 4.0. We test our GEF support on GEF version 3.7.2.
