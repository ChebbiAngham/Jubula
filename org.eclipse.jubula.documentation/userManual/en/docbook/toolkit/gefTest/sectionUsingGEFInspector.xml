  <title>Using the GEF inspector</title>
  <anchor role="helpid" xml:id="inspectorViewContextId">GEF Inspector View</anchor>
  <para>
    The GEF Inspector View in the ITE allows you to collect information
    about the textpath to an item from within your RCP AUT. For many
    of the actions on GEF figures, you will need to know the
    textpath. Using the accessibility plug-in will mean that the
    textpaths will be easier to determine without the inspector. See
    the Developer Manual for further information on creating your
    own accessibility plug-in.

  <para>
    To use the inspector, you must have started the AUT
    (<xref linkend="starting-the-aut"/>).

        In the GEF Inspector View, the path to the item will be shown. If
        the code for your AUT uses the accessibility code, then the
        textpath will be less complex and more readable.

        You can copy the textpath from the Inspector View via the
