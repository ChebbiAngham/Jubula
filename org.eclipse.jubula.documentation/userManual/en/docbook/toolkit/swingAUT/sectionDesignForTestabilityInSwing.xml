    <title>Naming components</title>
    <para>
      Although components in the AUT can be recognized even when
      they are not named by the developers, using the
      <emphasis>setName</emphasis> method for the current Swing
      component class certainly makes it easier to test AUTs. Even
      if a whole area of the AUT has changed, the component will
      still be found based on this unique name.

    <title>Adding support for text retrieval</title>
    <para>
      You can add support for renderers for Swing components without
      the getText() method in order to access text that is otherwise
      non-readable during test execution.

          This does not replace the support for custom Swing
          renderers that can be changed directly by your developers.

        <para>
          If you are able to change the renderers yourself, you can
          still implement one of the following in your renderer:

        <blockquote>
          <para>
            public String getTestableText(); public String
            getText();
