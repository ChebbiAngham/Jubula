% CAP description for Application --> Restart

\begin{itemize}
\item Use this action to restart the \gdaut{} during the test. 
\item The action closes your \gdaut{} and all windows/dialogs associated with it. 
\item It then starts the same \gdaut{} with the same configuration as it had when you originally started it and carries on with the test. 
\item If your \gdaut{} takes a while to load/to be ready, it is a good idea to use the \bxcaption{wait for window} or \bxcaption{wait for component} action after the restart action. 
\bxwarn{Do not use the restart action as the first \gdstep{} in a test.}
\end{itemize}

\bxtipp{If you want to close your \gdaut{} using e.g. the menu and have it restarted automatically, then use the actions to prepare for \gdaut{} termination and to synchronize termination and re-start of an \gdaut{}. }
