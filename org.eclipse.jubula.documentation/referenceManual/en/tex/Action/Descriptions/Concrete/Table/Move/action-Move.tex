% CAP description for Table --> Move
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Use this action to move from a currently selected cell to another cell.
\item You specify in which direction you want to move, and how far (number of cells).
\item You also specify how many clicks should be made on the new cell, if any.
\item This action is useful for navigating in a table.
\item This is achieved by:
\begin{itemize}
\item searching for the cell to move to
\item placing the cursor on this cell at the position you specify
\item clicking the amount of times you specify
\end{itemize}
%\item To move from a cell, the original cell must be active (selected). 
\item The movement is carried out relative to the cell where the cursor is. 
\item This is usually the selected cell, unless you have already carried out a 'move'' action. 
\item If the cursor is, for any reason, not currently over a cell, the movement is carried out relative to the selected cell. 
\end{itemize}

\bxtipp{This action is unsupported for the HTML toolkit}
