% CAP description for Tree --> Verify Indexpath
\begin{itemize}
\item This action checks that a node in the tree exists.
\item You give the path to the node you want to check as an indexpath. 
\item For example, checking a textpath of ''1/2/3'' would check that the first node in the tree has at least 2 child nodes, and that the 2nd child node has at least 3 child nodes.
