\subsection{New Features and Developments}

\textbf{Improved no-run option in testexec}
\begin{itemize}
\item The no-run option in the testexec now has a number of parameters so that you can define how far the test should be checked. 
\item You can use this option to perform all steps up to the actual test execution to ensure that e.g. \gdauts{} can be started, object mapping is complete etc.
\end{itemize}
