\textbf{New information in \gdomm{} : property information}
\begin{itemize}
\item When you collect a component in the \gdomm{} in a Swing or SWT/RCP \gdaut{}, you can now see information on the properties of that component in the \gdpropview{}.
\item The information is shown as a list of properties with their values. If a value cannot be accessed, this is communicated.
\item The information is not saved - to see the properties again, you must re-collect the component in the \gdomm{}.
\item This can be used to help you write tests that use the actions \bxname{check property} or \bxname{store property}.
\end{itemize}
