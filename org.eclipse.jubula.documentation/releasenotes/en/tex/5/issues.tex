\textbf{OS X: Green borders in AUT "flicker" in Object Mapping Mode}
\begin{itemize}
\item This issue occurs when collecting components from an SWT or RCP \gdaut{} running with the Cocoa implementation of SWT. As such, this problem may affect \gdauts{} running on OS X.
\item When the mouse is moved over components in the \gdaut{}, the green border alternately disappears and reappears with each movement. A component cannot be collected when the green border is not visible. In order to work around this issue, it may be necessary to move the mouse within the component until the green border (re)appears.
\end{itemize}
