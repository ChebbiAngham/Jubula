\begin{itemize}
\item You can now integrate your automated tests with external repositories which you have configured in your workspace and your \gdproject{}.

\item You can open the task for a node (if one is defined) from the browsers.  
\end{itemize}

\textbf{New option in the testexec}
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Comments can be added to the \gdproject{} and to categories}
\begin{itemize}
\item You can now add comments to the \gdproject{} and to categories in the \gdtestsuitebrowser{} and \gdtestcasebrowser{}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{New actions for testing checkboxes in SWT tables}
\begin{itemize}
