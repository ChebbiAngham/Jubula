\begin{itemize}
\item The driver used for the embedded H2 data base are updated from version
    1.1.117 to 1.3.168. These two versions are not compatible, because the file format
    has been changed. More information about changes in H2 are
    available at \url{http://www.h2database.com/html/changelog.html}.
\item Old embedded H2 data bases are not readable with the new version
    of \app(), but migration is possible with the following steps:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Export the old data base into a file by using the menu
            Test - Export All with your working version of \app().
        \item Install, start and the new version of \app().
        \item Import the previously exported file using the new version
            of \app().
