\textbf{Chronon support}
\begin{itemize}
\item \app{} now allows the use of an embedded Chronon recorder. 
\item Activating the embedded Chronon recorder in \app{} will result in your actions being recorded in a monitoring file which can be used for analysis purposes should you encounter any errors.
\item We do not recommend having Chronon running at all times, due to possible performance degradations through the monitoring. Instead, we recommend that you activate the Chronon recorder when you are trying to reproduce an error in \app{} to report to the team.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Tests updated to newer versions of IE and Firefox}
\begin{itemize}
\item The tested versions for web \gdauts{} now include IE 9 and Firefox 10
\end{itemize}
