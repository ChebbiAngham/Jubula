\textbf{Documentation error in Chronon section}
\begin{itemize}
\item The documentation for using Chronon while running an \gdaut{} specifies that the package pattern must be a regular expression. This is incorrect. The correct text should be: 
\begin{quote}Enter a comma-separated list of packages that you want to be covered by the monitoring. The packages must adhere to the patterns as defined in the Chronon documentation, for example \bxshell{com.myorg.**} selects the whole com.myorg namespace. \bxshell{com.myorg.*} selects only classes in the com.myorg package. The documentation for the patterns is located at \\
\href{https://chronon.onconfluence.com/display/DOC/Include+and+Exclude+patterns}{https://chronon.onconfluence.com/display\\
/DOC/Include+and+Exclude+patterns}.\\
 If you enter no patterns, the recording file will be empty.
