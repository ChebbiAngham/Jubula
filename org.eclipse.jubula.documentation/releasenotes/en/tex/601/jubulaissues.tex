\textbf{Documentation error in Chronon section}
\begin{itemize}
\item The documentation for using Chronon while running an \gdaut{} specifies that the package pattern must be a regular expression. This is incorrect. The correct text should be: 
\begin{quote}Enter a comma-separated list of packages that you want to be covered by the monitoring. The packages must adhere to the patterns as defined in the Chronon documentation, for example \bxshell{com.myorg.**} selects the whole com.myorg namespace. \bxshell{com.myorg.*} selects only classes in the com.myorg package. The documentation for the patterns is located at \\
\href{https://chronon.onconfluence.com/display/DOC/Include+and+Exclude+patterns}{https://chronon.onconfluence.com/display\\
/DOC/Include+and+Exclude+patterns}.\\
 If you enter no patterns, the recording file will be empty.
\end{quote}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Chronon and continuous integration}
\begin{itemize}
\item We do not advise using the version of Chronon integrated with \app{} as a part of long-running continuous integration tests (e.g. tests that are started via the test executor and run throughout the night).  
\item Instead, we recommend activating Chronon monitoring for an \gdaut{} configuration that you use to execute individual tests via the \ite{} to ensure that you get exactly the data you need.
\end{itemize}
