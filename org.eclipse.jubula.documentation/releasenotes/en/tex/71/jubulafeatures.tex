\textbf{New function for accessing node attribute}
\begin{itemize}
\item A new function has been added to the set of pre-defined functions in \app{}.
\item The function is: \bxname{?getNodeAttribute()} and it can have either \bxname{name} or \bxname{comment} as arguments.
\item When \bxname{name} is chosen, the function reads the name of the node (e.g. \gdcase{}, \gdstep{}) on which it is resolved and uses this for the test.
\item  When \bxname{comment} is chosen, the function reads the comment of the node (e.g. \gdcase{}, \gdstep{}) on which it is resolved and uses this for the test.
\end{itemize}
