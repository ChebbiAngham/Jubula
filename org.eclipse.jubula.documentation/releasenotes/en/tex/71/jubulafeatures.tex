\textbf{New function for accessing node attribute}
\begin{itemize}
\item A new function has been added to the set of pre-defined functions in \app{}.
\item The function is: \bxname{?getNodeAttribute()} and it can have either \bxname{name} or \bxname{comment} as arguments.
\item When \bxname{name} is chosen, the function reads the name of the node (e.g. \gdcase{}, \gdstep{}) on which it is resolved and uses this for the test.
\item  When \bxname{comment} is chosen, the function reads the comment of the node (e.g. \gdcase{}, \gdstep{}) on which it is resolved and uses this for the test.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Multi-window support for HTML \gdauts{}}
\begin{itemize}
\item If your HTML \gdaut{} uses multi windows (e.g. pop-ups), then you can now specify this in the \gdaut{} configuration. 
\item \gdauts{} that are running in multi-window mode show the Selenium console as well as the \gdaut{} when the \gdaut{} is started. 
\item The \gdomeditor{} has a new button to allow switching between multiple open windows for mapping components, and there are new actions in the HTML unbound modules to allow you to switch between windows during the test. 
\end{itemize}
