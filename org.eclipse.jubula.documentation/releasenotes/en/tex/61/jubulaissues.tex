\textbf{Mac OSX Mountain Lion gatekeeper prevents install4j generated installer from starting}
\begin{itemize}
\item This is caused by a too-restrictive setting on the Mountain Lion gatekeeper security feature.
\item Setting the security level to Mac OSX Lion compatible level resolves the issue.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Actions: Check selection of entry by index/value only checks one entry}
\begin{itemize}
\item The actions for checking whether an item in a list is selected have been adapted so that they only accept one piece of data, and not comma-separated values as was previously the case.
\item To check whether multiple items are selected, use a data set which contains a list of the items to check. 
\end{itemize}
