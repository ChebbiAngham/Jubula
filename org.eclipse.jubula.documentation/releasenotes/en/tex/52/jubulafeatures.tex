\textbf{Embedded gdagent{}}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item If you are starting your \gdaut{} and running your tests on your local machine, 
you can now connect to an embedded \gdagent{} directly from the \ite. 
\item This saves you having to start an \gdagent{} on localhost. 
\item This is also useful for testers working with \jb{} as a feature in an Eclipse installation. 
\item The embedded \gdagent{} is started on port 60000 by default; this number can be changed in the preferences.
\end{itemize}
