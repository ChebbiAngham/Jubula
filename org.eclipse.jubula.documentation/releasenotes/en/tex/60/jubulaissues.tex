\textbf{New workspaces required}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Due to changes to internal IDs, a new workspace is required for this version. 
\item You can export your database preferences from your old workspace and import them into your new one. 
\item Other preferences must be noted and manually updated in the new workspace. 
\end{itemize}

%% \textbf{Support for adding basic component extensions to a \gdproject{}}\\
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item Alongside the full extension mechanism for adding new supported components and actions, there is now an easier way to add basic support 
%% for as yet unsupported components. 
%% \item In the \gdproject{} properties, there is a new area for \bxname{Component Extensions}. On this page, you can enter the class name 
%% (e.g. \bxname{javax.swing.JSeparator}) for currently unsupported components. 
%% \item The component types you add must be of the type \bxname{JComponent} in Swing and \bxname{Control} in SWT. This mechanism is not currently supported for HTML \gdauts{}.
%% \item Once you have added the component, you will be able to collect components of this type in the \gdomm{} and you will be able to perform 
%% actions on them that are defined for \bxname{Graphics Component} (i.e. clicking, waiting for them, checking their existence, enablement, focus and properties).
