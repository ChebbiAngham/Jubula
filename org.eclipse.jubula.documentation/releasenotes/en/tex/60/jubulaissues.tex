\textbf{New workspaces required}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Due to changes to internal IDs, a new workspace is required for this version. 
\item You can export your database preferences from your old workspace and import them into your new one. 
\item Other preferences must be noted and manually updated in the new workspace. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\gdagent{} takes longer to start}
\begin{itemize}
\item In the current version, the \gdagent{} takes longer to start than in previous versions. 
\item If you try to connect to an \gdagent{} before it is running, you will receive an information message that the connection could not be established.
\item You may need to bear this in mind for automated tests in a continuous build and test environment.
\end{itemize}
