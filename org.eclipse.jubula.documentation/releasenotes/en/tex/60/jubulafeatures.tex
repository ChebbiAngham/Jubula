\textbf{Selenium update}
\begin{itemize}
\item The version of Selenium used by \app{} has been updated to 2.12.0.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Test Execution Duration now shown for each node in \gdtestresultview{}}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item The amount of time taken to execute each \gdstep{}, \gdcase{} and \gdsuite{} is now shown in the \gdtestresultview{}.
\item You can use this information to see whether your tests or parts of your tests are taking longer than you expected them to, 
without having to set timers or manually check timestamps.
\item The HTML and XML reports generated or exported for the test results also show the execution times.
\item You can switch off the decoration in the \app{} client in the \bxname{label decoration} preferences.
\end{itemize} 

\textbf{Categories now supported in the \gdtestsuitebrowser{} and \gddataeditor}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item It is now possible to create categories for \gdsuites{} and \gdjobs{} in the \gdtestsuitebrowser{}, as well as for central data sets in the \gddataeditor{}. 
\item Existing \gdprojects{} will be shown as having two categories (\bxname{Test Suites} and \bxname{Test Jobs}) in the \gdtestsuitebrowser{} as was previously the case. However, you can now rename, delete and rearrange categories in the \gdtestsuitebrowser{}. 
\end{itemize} 

\textbf{Parameter values now shown for each node in \gdtestresultview{}}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item The parameter values entered or used at a specific level (\gdcase{}, \gdstep{}) are now shown in the \gdtestresultview{}.
\item You can use this information to see which data were used for your \gdcases{}, without having to click through each individual node in the \gdtestresultview{}. This can be especially useful if you have one \gdcase{} that runs multiple times with different datasets.
\item You can switch off the decoration in the \app{} client in the \bxname{label decoration} preferences.
\end{itemize} 

\textbf{Save As New \gdcase{}}
\begin{itemize}
\item There is a new option in the \gdtestcaseeditor{} and \gdtestsuiteeditor{} to save selected items as a new \gdcase{}.
\item The selected nodes are added to a new \gdcase{} whose name you define.
\item The nodes are not copied, but their references are: the effect is the same as if you had manually created a new \gdcase{} and added the \gdcases{} to it. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Completeness check shown as progress window}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item After saving in the \ite{}, the completeness check which validates the state of the \gdproject{} (test data, object mapping, missing \gdcases{} etc) is now shown explicitly as a progress window.
\item This results from performance improvements made to the completeness check.
\end{itemize} 

\textbf{Changes to layout of properties view for test results}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item The properties view for test results now shows all test data as two columns: the parameter name and the value.
\item This reduces the amount of space required to see test data for test results. 
\end{itemize}
