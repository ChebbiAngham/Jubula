      <para>
        Whether or not a test run is relevant is now determined by a
        property on each Test Suite. This better reflects the
        situation that specific Test Suites will always be relevant
        and others never.

        The meaning of relevance has not changed. However, the entry
        from the preferences has been removed and the parameter for
        the testexec is no longer accepted.
