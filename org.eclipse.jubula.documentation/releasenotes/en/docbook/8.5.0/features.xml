        We introduced a new feature in the Test Case Browser called <emphasis>Delete with Orphans</emphasis>.

        When tidying up a project, there are Test Cases that are no longer required or used.
        The <emphasis>Delete with Orphans</emphasis> feature allows you to show all Test Cases
        that would remain unused if a certain Test Case were deleted. It then offers you
        to delete the Test Case with all its remaining "Orphans".
