 <emphasis role="strong">Deletion with Orphans</emphasis>
</para>

  <listitem>
    <para>
        We introduced a new feature in the Test Case Browser called <emphasis>Delete with Orphans</emphasis>.
    </para>

  <listitem>
    <para>
        When tidying up a project, there are Test Cases that are no longer required or used.
        The <emphasis>Delete with Orphans</emphasis> feature allows you to show all Test Cases
        that would remain unused if a certain Test Case were deleted. It then offers you
        to delete the Test Case with all its remaining "Orphans".

  <emphasis role="strong">Import project files by drag and drop</emphasis>
</para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
     <para>
       It is now possible to import <emphasis>.jub</emphasis> project files
       by dragging them to the Test Suite Browser View of the ITE. If only
       one project is imported this way, it is automatically opened. Please note
       that this feature is not supported on some Linux distributions.

<emphasis role="strong">Improved Replace Test Case References operation</emphasis>
</para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
        It is now possible to choose default values for unmatched parameters in the Replace Test Case Reference operation (the non-Editor version).
        These default values can not contain references, but all other types are usable (e.g. variables and functions).

  <para>
    <emphasis role="strong">Added the possibility to use a static IP Address and port for the AUT - Client connection.</emphasis>
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        This is possible by setting the JVM properties <emphasis>jubClientAddr</emphasis> and <emphasis>jubClientPort</emphasis> in either
        the <emphasis>jubula.ini</emphasis> or the <emphasis>testexec.vmoptions</emphasis> configuration files.

    <emphasis role="strong">Double clicking on Test Case Editor root nodes</emphasis>
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        To help navigating between Editors, we added a new feature: when double-clicking a Test Case Editor's root node, if
        there is a single Editor open which references the given Test Case, that Editor is activated. If there are more than one
        such Editors open, you can choose one to activate in a dialog. And if there is no such Editor open, you can
        choose a Test Case or Test Suite which references the Test Case, and open its Editor. 
      </para>

  <para>
    <emphasis role="strong">Added the possibility to jump to a referenced data set from the Properties View.</emphasis>
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
        It is now possible to try to jump to a data set which is referenced by a parameter through the getCentralTestDataSetValue
        function. In case the row and cell are identifiable from the arguments of the function then they are also selected in the Data
        Sets View.
