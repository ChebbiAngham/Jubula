        We introduced a new feature in the Test Case Browser called <emphasis>Delete with Orphans</emphasis>.

        When tidying up a project, there are Test Cases that are no longer required or used.
        The <emphasis>Delete with Orphans</emphasis> feature allows you to show all Test Cases
        that would remain unused if a certain Test Case were deleted. It then offers you
        to delete the Test Case with all its remaining "Orphans".

     <para>
       It is now possible to import <emphasis>.jub</emphasis> project files
       by dragging them to the Test Suite Browser View of the ITE. If only
       one project is imported this way, it is automatically opened. Please note
       that this feature is not supported on some Linux distributions.

    <para>
        It is now possible to choose default values for unmatched parameters in the Replace Test Case Reference operation (the non-Editor version).
        These default values can not contain references, but all other types are usable (e.g. variables and functions).
