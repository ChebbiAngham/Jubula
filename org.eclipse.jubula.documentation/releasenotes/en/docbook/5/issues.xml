        This issue occurs when collecting components from an SWT or
        RCP AUT running with the Cocoa implementation of SWT. As such,
        this problem may affect AUTs running on OS X.

        When the mouse is moved over components in the AUT, the green
        border alternately disappears and reappears with each
        movement. A component cannot be collected when the green
        border is not visible. In order to work around this issue, it
        may be necessary to move the mouse within the component until
        the green border (re)appears.
