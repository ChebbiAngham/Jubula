     	We no longer build the product with the name GUIdancer.
     	Since Jubula and GUIdancer have been functionally identical in 
     	the standalone versions since 2013, this simply avoids confusion by
     	only having one name.

  		Any scripts in your test execution that use the string GUIdancer 
  		should be changed once you update to a new Jubula release.
