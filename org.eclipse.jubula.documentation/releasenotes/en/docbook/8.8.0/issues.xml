    There is a possibility that in a Linux environment the Highlighting
    of
    supported components is leading to a big performance drop and is
    even
    not working correctly. We have added the possibility to
    disable
    this highlighting of supported components with the property
    <emphasis>TEST_RC_DISABLE_HIGHLIGHTING</emphasis>
    with the value
    <emphasis>true</emphasis>
    . After this no
    supported component is highlighted but you can still
    try to map
    components and they will show up in the Object Mapping
    editor.
