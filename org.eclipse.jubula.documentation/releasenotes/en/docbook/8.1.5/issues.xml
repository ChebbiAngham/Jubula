                : The fix for this issue might require a
                re-mapping of
                (many) UI components for your JavaFX AUT within
                the
                Object Mapping Editor. This is necessary as the
                quality
                of the (already existing) object mapping
                information
                might not be sufficient enough to either
                find the UI
                component again (leading to a component
                not
                found error
                during test execution) or to find another
                one as being
                more likely (likely leading to odd action errors).
                Please keep this in mind if
                you experience problems after
                switching to this version.
