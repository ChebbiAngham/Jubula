                We removed the support for iOS toolkit. It is no longer possible to create projects and start AUTs using these two toolkits.

             Instead of having two separate directories in the installation 
             folder for the ITE tools (Jubula, testexec, dbtool) and the AUT Agent tools
             (AUT Agent, autrun), there is now only one folder, 'ite'.

                We removed the Atlassian connector since it is deprecated. If you want to connect Jubula to another ALM besides to
                Bugzilla and Trac you will have to use the commercially available Tasktop Dev connectors.
