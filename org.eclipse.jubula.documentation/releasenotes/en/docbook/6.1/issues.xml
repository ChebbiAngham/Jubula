      <para>
        The actions for checking whether an item in a list is selected
        have been adapted so that they only accept one piece of data,
        and not comma-separated values as was previously the case.

        To check whether multiple items are selected, use a data set
        which contains a list of the items to check.

        Due to changes we will be making to our implementation classes
