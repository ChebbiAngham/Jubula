        We added the possibility to search for places where a given cell in a Central Test
        Data is referenced through the <emphasis role="strong">?getCentralTestDataValue</emphasis>
        function. The results are classified as being exact (when the exact cell is referenced) and
        approximate (when the column of the cell is referenced). Please note that only the literal
        references are found (e.g. those which do not use parameters, variables or other function calls).
