    <para>
     Due to the fast development in the Browser segment, we have decided that in the next release
     we will drop the support for the HTML Toolkit. We recommend that you use Selenium directly.

    <para>
     Java 9 and later applications must be started with the jvm arguments
     '--add-opens=javafx.controls/javafx.scene.control.skin=ALL-UNNAMED-illegal-access=permit'.
     This is necessary because we are using
     internal information to get e.g. some position information of
     components.

  <listitem>
    <para>
 There is a problem that extensions are not loaded if using the OM via
 the AUTAgent context menu. If you are using the embedded agent for API
 you can register new Testerclasses to the ToolkitInformation and than
 start the Embedded agent.
