    <title>New Features and Developments</title>
<para>
 <emphasis role="strong">Conditional Statements and Loops</emphasis>
</para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
        We introduced new nodes altering the test execution flow: Conditional Statements and Loops.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
        The <emphasis>If-Then-Else-node</emphasis> allows you to specify one or 
        more test cases or test steps as a condition. Based upon the result of 
        the condition nodes, either the "then" or the "else" branch will be 
        entered and the containing nodes will be executed. The condition can
        also be negated.  
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
        The <emphasis>While-Do-node</emphasis> and the 
        <emphasis>Do-While-Node</emphasis> will both repeat the test nodes
        inside the "do"-branch until the condition is no longer being met. In 
        contrary to the While-Do-node, the Do-While-node checks the condition
        after each run through the "do"-branch. Therefore the Do-While-node will
        always run at least once.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
        The <emphasis>Repeat-node</emphasis> repeats the nodes inside the "do"-branch
        for a specified amount of times.
    </para>

<para>
 <emphasis role="strong">Invoke External Methods</emphasis>
</para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      It is now possible to invoke external (AUT - independent) methods through the Reflection component.
      The external JAR files must be placed in the directory <emphasis>&lt;installation-directory&gt;/ite/externaljars</emphasis>.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
 <emphasis role="strong">Component Names</emphasis>
</para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Component name types are calculated and treated differently from this release onwards.
      The type becomes only decorative, so actions resulting in invalid component name types
      are allowed from now on, however, the user is warned before any action resulting in an
      invalid type. Component names with invalid type are decorated by error markers, just like
      component names which are mapped into a component which does not realize one of the
      actions which might be executed on the component name.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      A new feature is added to the Component Name Browser: it is now possible to display the usage counter
      for component names. This shows the number of places in the current project where the component name is
      used. Users can turn this feature on and off in the <emphasis>Test - Editors</emphasis> preference window.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
 <emphasis role="strong">Check actions with timeout parameter</emphasis>
</para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
 <para>
  Most of the check actions do now have a timeout parameter. If there is a
  timeout value greater than 0 the check action is checking
  multiple times if the wanted status has occurred. If this did not
  happen until the timeout is reached the check is marked as check
  failed.
 </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
 <emphasis role="strong">Skipping test steps</emphasis>
</para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
 <para>
  Test steps can now be skipped by changing the value of at least one parameter
  of a test step to '##jbskip##'.
 </para>
