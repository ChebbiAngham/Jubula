      It is now possible to invoke external (AUT - independent) methods through the Reflection component.
      The external JAR files must be placed in the directory <emphasis>&lt;installation-directory&gt;/ite/externaljars</emphasis>.

      Component Name types are calculated and treated differently from this release onwards.
      The type becomes only a decoration, so actions resulting in invalid Component Name types
      are allowed from now on, however, the user is warned before any action resulting in an
      invalid type. Component Names with invalid type are decorated by error markers, just like
      Component Names which are mapped into a Component which does not realize one of the
      actions which might be executed on the Component Name.
