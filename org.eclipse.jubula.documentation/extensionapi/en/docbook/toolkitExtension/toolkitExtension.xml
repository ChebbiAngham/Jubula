    creating an ITE toolkit extension with custom defined components and
    actions. This chapter begins by listing the requirements followed by

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        The ITE toolkit extension – by writing your own <emphasis role="strong">toolkit</emphasis> plug-in:
        This will tell the ITE which new components and actions are available.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      The remote control extension – by writing your own <emphasis role="strong">fragment</emphasis>:
      This part actually performs the actions on the new components.

    In this chapter all used directory names are located in the
