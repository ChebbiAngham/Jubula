\chapter{Creating ITE functions}
\label{functions}

Functions represent program code that is evaluated during test execution.
In order to define a new  function, you will need to create an extension
for the extension point \bxname{org.eclipse.jubula.client.core.functions}, which
can be found in the bundle \bxname{org.eclipse.jubula.client.core}. This
bundle also contains reference implementations of the extension point.
