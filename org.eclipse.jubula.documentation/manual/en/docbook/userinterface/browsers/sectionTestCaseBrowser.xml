  <para>
    The Test Case Browser is by default in the lower left-hand
    corner of the Specification Perspective. In this browser, you
    can create Test Cases, which are the ”building blocks” for your
    tests. They are used to group Test Steps and other Test Cases.

    More information on working with browsers is available in the
    Tasks (<xref linkend="working-with-browsers"/>). To make working with
    larger Projects easier, you can also have the Test Case Browser
    open more than once (<xref linkend="opening-the-test-case-browser-multiple-times"/>).
