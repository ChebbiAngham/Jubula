  <title>Observing user actions</title>
  <para>
    As explained in the introduction (<xref linkend="recorded-tests"/>) and in
    the section on how to record (<xref linkend="tips-and-tricks-observation-mode"/>), we believe
    that recording tests has various disadvantages in any tool.

    However, you can observe Test Cases in a running Java AUT.
    You can record actions and checks in your AUT, and the output
    for these actions is Test Steps.
  </para>
  <para>
    You can create the same tests with observing as you can with
    specification. The real differences are:

        object mapping is carried out automatically in observing mode.
        Because of this, you do not provide a component name, but one
        is created automatically.

        you must use concrete values for parameters in the observation
        mode. You can (and should), however, change these to
        references in the specification perspective later so that your
        tests are more reusable.

  <para>
    You can reuse observed Test Cases in the same ways as you can
    reuse specified Test Cases.

    <para role="tip">The observation mode supports high level actions. To find out
    exactly how an action works, look up the component and its action in
