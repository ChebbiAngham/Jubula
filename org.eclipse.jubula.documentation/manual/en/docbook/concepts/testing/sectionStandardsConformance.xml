  <title>Standards conformance</title>
  <para>
    If components have been derived and altered such that they no
    longer respond to actions in the same way (i.e. rewriting the
    single-click event for a textbox, non-standard responses to
    certain key combinations, etc.), they may no longer be testable
    out of the box.

    It is therefore recommended for the purposes of testing – and
    also for the sake of conformance to usability standards – that
    the toolkit conventions are held to.

    There may, of course, be situations where exceptions are
    necessary. For this reason, there is an API via which testing
    classes can be implemented so that even changed components can
    be tested. See the Extension Manual for more information.
