    This is a client-server application. We refer to the client part
    as the Integrated Test Environment or ITE, and the server
    component as the AUT Agent.:

    You can install the ITE and AUT Agent on different machines; even
    on different platforms. This lets you specify and run your tests
    on different machines, and means that you can run the same test on
    different platforms.
