    <title>Test Step execution</title>
    <para>
      Tests are executed tests on the following basis:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          A user-defined component is located in the user interface of
          the AUT.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The specified action is executed on this component, with the
          parameters you gave for the action.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      The success of an action is based on whether it was carried out
      or not. There are no implicit checks which verify the state of
      the application to check if the execution of an action actually
      had an effect. For example, if an action is carried out to click
      a button, this Test Step will be marked as successful even if
      the button is disabled. From the remote control perspective, a
      click was executed on the button component.
    </para>
    <para>
      It is worth bearing this in mind if a test has failed,
      especially because of a ”component not found” error. What may
      have happened is that a further component was not found due to a
      dialog still being in focus, because the
      ”<emphasis>close</emphasis>” button was disabled, for example.
      Although a click was executed on this button, it did not have
      the desired effect. The test continued, but ran into problems.
