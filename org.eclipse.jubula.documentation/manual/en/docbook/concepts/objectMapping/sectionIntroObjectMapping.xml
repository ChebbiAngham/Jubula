  <title>Introduction to the object mapping</title>
  <para>
    Object mapping is the process which joins your <emphasis>component
    names</emphasis> from your Test Steps to the actual
    <emphasis>technical names</emphasis> for the components in the
    AUT. Because object mapping can be the last step before execution,
    you can start specifying tests before the software is even
    available.
  </para>
  <para>
    Object mapping consists of two steps:

    <listitem>
      <para>
        Collecting the technical names for the components from the
        AUT.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Assigning these technical names to the component names you
        used in your Test Steps.
      </para>
    </listitem>

  <para>
    <para role="tip">Object mapping is bound to the AUT, not to a Test
    Suite. All Test Suites which use the same AUT share an object map.
