  <title>Component names</title>
  <para>
    When you specify Test Steps, you specify component names for the
    components you want to test. When you add Test Cases to a Test
    Suite, all component names used in the Test Cases are collected
    by the Object Mapping Editor. You can then collect the technical
    names from the AUT.
