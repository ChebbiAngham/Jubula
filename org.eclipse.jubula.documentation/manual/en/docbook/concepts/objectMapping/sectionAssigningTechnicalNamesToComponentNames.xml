  <title>Assigning technical names to component names</title>
  <para>
    Once you have collected the technical names from the AUT, you
    can ”assign” them to the component names using drag-and-drop. In
    this way, you are telling your test which real component you are
    referring to in each Test Step.
  </para>
  <para>
    The fact that the object map is separate from the specification
    means that any changes that need to be made to update a test
    only need to be made once.
