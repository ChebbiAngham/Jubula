  <title>Creating modules from existing Test Cases</title>
  <para>
    It is often initially more intuitive to start writing a test in
    a linear fashion, adding steps as necessary. Each step is
    specified for the current purpose, and contains all the
    necessary details (e.g. data).
  </para>
  <para>
    The possible problem with this method is that similar or
    identical parts are often separately and multiply specified,
    which means that making changes at a later point can be
    difficult and time-consuming.
  </para>
  <para>
    To avoid this, you can extract Test Cases from other Test Cases
    to combine them into reusable modules
    (<xref linkend="extracting-test-cases-from-editors-refactoring"/>).
