  <title>Introduction to the reusability of test cases</title>
  <para>
    Test Cases are the reusable units. Test Cases can be referenced in
    other Test Cases to create modularly built tests.
  </para>
  <para>
    Being able to reuse Test Cases means that you should put some
    thought into how to design them so that they are as specific as
    they need to be while also being generic enough to reuse in
    different situations.
  </para>
  <para>
    You can improve the flexibility of a Test Case by:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Using references (<xref linkend="using-references-for-data-in-test-cases"/>) instead of
        concrete data if the data can change. References allow you to
        feed a Test Case with different data each time you reuse it.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Using the abstract components (e.g. component with text,
        component with text input, graphics component)
        (<xref linkend="ConceptsAbstractComps"/>) to specify your tests wherever
        possible.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Allowing the component it tests to be defined when you reuse
        it (<xref linkend="entering-and-reassigning-component-names-in-the-component-names-view"/>).
      </para>
    </listitem>
