    If you have reused a Test Case at multiple places in your
    Project, and later create a new Test Case that should replace
    it, then you can perform a mass replace via the Search Result
    View. If you just want to replace one single place where a Test
    Case has been reused, then you can either select that Test Case
    in the Search Result View or use the in-editor replace
    (<xref linkend="replacing-test-cases-in-editors-refactoring"/>).
  </para>
  <para>
    <para role="warning">In order to perform a mass replace, all Test Cases to be
    changed must not be in use by anyone else using the Project –
    you should ensure that this is the case before performing the
    replace, otherwise the replace cannot be carried out. You should
    also be aware before performing this action that it cannot be
    undone.</para>
  </para>
  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Search for all places where the Test Case you want to
        replace is used e.g. <emphasis>Show where used</emphasis>

        In the Search Result View, you will see all places where the
        selected Test Case is reused in this Project, including in
        other Test Cases, in Test Suites and anywhere you have used
        the Test Case as an Event Handler. Select all entries, or
        just the Test Case references you want to replace with a new
        Test Case reference. <para role="warning">You will only be able to perform
        the replace if all selected Test Case references use the
        same original Test Case. The context-menu entry will be
        disabled if the Project is protected, or any of the selected
        Test Cases are missing (e.g. from reused Projects)</para>.

        The first page of a wizard will appear. Here, you can choose
        the Test Case you want to use as a replacement at the places
        you selected. It is a good idea to select a Test Case that
        ”fits well” (in terms of any component names it propagates
        and parameters it references) to the Test Case you are
        replacing. You will be able to map any compatible components
        and parameter names in the next steps.

        On this page, you can match any component names propagated
        (<xref linkend="propagating-component-names"/>) from the newly selected Test
        Case to already existing propagated component names from the
        old Test Case. On the left-hand side, you can see names that
        are propagated from the newly chosen Test Case. On the
        right-hand side, you can:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            match the new names to existing names if there are
            compatible names available in the existing Test Case.
            The information for names you match in this way will be
            transferred from the existing Test Case to the new Test
            Case when the replacement occurs. Any new names entered,
            or further propagations at the places of reuse, will
            also be transferred. This is the best way of ensuring
            that your Project structure is the same after the
            replace.

            choose to leave any combo boxes empty. In this case, no

            see if there are no names available, either because
            there is no compatible type for matching in the existing
            Test Case, or because the existing Test Case had no
            propagated component names. In such cases, the new
            component name will be used.

        On this page, you can match any referenced parameter names
        (<xref linkend="using-references-for-data-in-test-cases"/>) from the newly selected Test
        Case to already existing referenced parameter names from the
        old Test Case. On the left-hand side, you can see parameters
        that are referenced from the newly chosen Test Case. On the
        right-hand side you can:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            match the new parameter to existing parameters if there
            are compatible types available in the existing Test
            Case. The data for any parameters you match in this way
            will be transferred from the existing Test Case to the
            new Test Case when the replacement occurs. Any test data
            entered locally, any test data referenced from the
            original specification, and any central test data sets
            or Excel tables used, will also be transferred. This is
            the best way of ensuring that your Project structure is
            the same after the replace.
