  <title>Introduction to categories</title>
  <para>
    Categories let you group items together to be able to keep an
    overview of your data and find things more easily. You can use
    categories in the Test Case Browser, in the Test Suite Browser, in
    the Central Test Data Editor and in the Object Mapping Editor (see
    the section on object mapping for information on categories in the
    Object Mapping Editor (<xref linkend="working-with-categories-in-the-object-mapping-editor"/>)).
