  <title>Showing BIRT reports in an external viewer</title>
  <para>
    The BIRT reports are shown in an integrated BIRT report viewer.
  </para>
  <para>
    If you have a BIRT report viewer elsewhere (e.g. in a Tomcat
    server), then you can put the templates and the library into the
    external BIRT viewer on the server and view them without
    starting the ITE.

    For information on viewing BIRT reports in external viewers,
    please consult the BIRT documentation.
