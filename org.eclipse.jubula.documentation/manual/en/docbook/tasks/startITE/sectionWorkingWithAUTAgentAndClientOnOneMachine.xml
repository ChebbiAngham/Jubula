  <title>Working with the AUT Agent and client on one machine</title>
  <anchor role="helpid" id="problemViewContextId">Problem View</anchor>
  <para>
    If the ITE and AUT Agent are installed on one machine, there are a few things
    to be aware of:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Donâ€™t use the mouse or any keyboard shortcuts during
        execution. The AUT takes control of the machine it is
        running on during test execution.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Make sure that the AUT is visible during test execution:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The ITE is minimized by default when test execution
            begins. Make sure that the AUT is the next window to
            receive focus when the ITE is minimized.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            You can change the preference to minimize the ITE via:
            
            <para>
              <emphasis role="menuPath">Window</emphasis>--&gt;<emphasis role="menuPath">Preferences</emphasis>
            </para>
            
            If you do this, make sure that the AUT can also be seen on the screen when test execution begins.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
