  <title>Introduction to regular expressions and matching</title>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        For many search and selection actions, you can use regular
        expressions (using the <emphasis>matches</emphasis> operator) or simple
        matching (using the <emphasis>simple match</emphasis> operator) to avoid
        having to enter strings as exactly as they appear in the user
        interface.

      <para>
        Using regular expressions lets you verify or select text even
        if you do not know exactly what the text is.

    <listitem>
      <para>
        Using a system of placeholders for characters and some
        function symbols, you can enter a regular expression to find
        or check a text.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Actions which support regular expressions have an additional
        parameter, ”<emphasis>Operator</emphasis>”.
