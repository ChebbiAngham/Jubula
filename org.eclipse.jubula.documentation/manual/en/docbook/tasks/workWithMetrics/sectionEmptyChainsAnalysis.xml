  <title>Empty chains analysis</title>
  <para>
    This analysis is in the category <emphasis>Analysis</emphasis>.
  </para>
  <para>
    This analysis examines the current scope for test hierarchies
    wherein a Test Case is reused in one place – alone in another
    Test Case. This Test Case is then also reused in one place –
    again alone which is then reused in one place alone in another
    Test Case and so on. Such hierarchies can often be redundant:
    the Test Case at the bottom of the hierarchy could just as well
    have been reused directly in the Test Case at the top of the
    hierarchy.
  </para>
  <para>
    Such empty chains are collected during the analysis (which may
    take longer on larger Projects) and displayed in the Search
    Result View. They are shown in order of their length, starting
    with the longest chains.
