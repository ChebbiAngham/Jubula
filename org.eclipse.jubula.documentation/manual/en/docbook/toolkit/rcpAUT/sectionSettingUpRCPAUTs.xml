  <title>Setting up an RCP AUT for testing</title>
  <para>
    If you want to test a <emphasis>Rich Client Platform</emphasis>
    application, you must ensure that our ”<emphasis>RCP Remote
    Control</emphasis>” plugin (org.eclipse.jubula.rc.rcp) is added
    to your AUT and that it will be started when the AUT starts. If
    you are working in a continuous build and test process, then we
    highly recommend doing this as a part of the product build, or
    just afterwards (<xref linkend="setting-up-an-rcp-aut"/>). For testing purposes,
    and to get started quicker, the steps can also be done manually
    as follows:

        <emphasis>development</emphasis> folder.

        Extract the content of the

      <para>
        RCP applications generally have a configuration/config.ini
        file which contains the parameter
        <emphasis>osgi.bundles</emphasis>. This parameter needs to
        be modified to allow the RCP remote control plugin to load
        on AUT startup. You must add
        <emphasis>,org.eclipse.jubula.rc.rcp@start</emphasis> (the
        comma is important to delimit this argument from the others)
        to the end of the <emphasis>osgi.bundles</emphasis>
        parameter.

        In the <emphasis>plugin details</emphasis> for your AUT, you
        should be able to see that the following plugins are
        started:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        If you can see these plugins, then you can continue and
        start your AUT via e.g. an AUT configuration
        (<xref linkend="configuring-a-java-aut-ite-start"/>) or via
        <emphasis>autrun</emphasis> (<xref linkend="starting-java-with-the-command"/>).
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        If you cannot see these plugins, then you should speak to a
        member of the development team to implement the suggestions
        described in the section below (<xref linkend="setting-up-an-rcp-aut"/>).

    <para role="tip">When you install a new version of the ITE, you must
    repeat these steps with the new RCP remote control plugin. We

    not follow these steps, the AUT Agent will not be able to

    <title>Setting up an RCP AUT for testing as a part of the build

    <para>
      We recommend adding the RCP accessor to your AUT automatically
      in one of the following ways. Which way you choose will depend
      on your AUT, build process and Eclipse version, and you should
      check with the development team which approach is best:

          During the product build:
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Adding the RCP Accessor as a plugin to your AUT as it is
            being built is one way to ensure that it is present and
            started when the AUT starts.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>
          Via the OSGI console:
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            If adding the Accessor during the build is not an
            option, then you can add it after the build via the OSGI
            console. The availability of this option is dependent on
            the version of Eclipse you use, and your AUT: It must
            allow this type of post-hoc inclusion of plugins for
            this to work.

        </listitem>

          Via the P2 director:
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Alternatively, you can add it after the product build
            using the P2 director. The availability of this option
            is dependent on the version of Eclipse you use, and your
            AUT: It must allow this type of post-hoc inclusion of
            plugins for this to work.
