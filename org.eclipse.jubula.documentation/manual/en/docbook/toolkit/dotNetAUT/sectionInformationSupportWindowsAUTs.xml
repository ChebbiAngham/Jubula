  <title>Information on the support for Windows AUTs</title>
  <section id="the-ui-automation-framework-and-clicking">
    <title>The UI Automation Framework and clicking</title>
    <para>
      The Windows support is realized using the Microsoft UI
      Automation Framework. This framework is used to access
      components and to perform many of the supported actions. The
      Automation Framework is the recommended approach to
      controlling .NET AUTs, and it does not perform clicks or text
      inputs at the Operating System level; rather it invokes
      functions on the components.
    </para>
    <para>
      For the majority of the click actions, however, we have
      implemented real clicks that are performed at the Operating
      System level in order to allow e.g. opening of context-menus
      via right click, clicks at specific positions and
      position-based access (e.g. for context-menus, move actions
      and check at mouse position).

    <title>Supported AUTs</title>
    <para>
      We currently only support WinForms and WPF AUTs. It may be
      possible to map components from e.g. Win32 AUTs, but the tests
      on such components may fail. It is therefore worth checking
      with your development team what components the AUT you are
      testing is using.
