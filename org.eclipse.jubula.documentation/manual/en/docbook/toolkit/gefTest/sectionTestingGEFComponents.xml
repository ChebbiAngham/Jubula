    Like other tests, tests for GEF components are based on the component, action, parameter
    principle. However, it is important to note that individual figures are not addressed
    using component names. The only component that is mapped in GEF
    is the <emphasis>figure canvas</emphasis>. The figures on the canvas are
    tested by referring to their textpath. See the Reference Manual
    for more details on the GEF actions.
