  <title>Sample 2.4: testing tabbed panes, lists, combo
  boxes</title>
  <para>
    This category contains four Test Cases. The first two,
    <emphasis>Fill in the Content Tab</emphasis> and <emphasis>Fill
    in the Technics Tab</emphasis> contain Test Cases reused from
    the <emphasis>unbound_modules_concrete</emphasis> Project and
    the <emphasis>bound_modules_samples</emphasis> Project. These
    Test Cases execute various actions on the tabbed panes in the
    DVD Tool. There is a lot of reuse of Test Cases, especially on
    different components. The <emphasis>Enter a Text
    Detail</emphasis> Test Case, for example, is reused three times,
    with a different component name each time. The <emphasis>Fill in
    the Technics Tab</emphasis> Test Case also contains an Event
    Handler to check a checkbox if it isnâ€™t already done so. Many of
    the parameters in these Test Cases have been referenced so that
    values can be entered for them later.
  </para>
  <para>
    The last two Test Cases each contain a Test Case to select a
    DVD, and then contain the <emphasis>Fill in the Content
    Tab</emphasis> and <emphasis>Fill in the Technics Tab</emphasis>
    Test Cases. Because the values in these Test Cases were left
    empty, different data can be entered for each Test Case.
