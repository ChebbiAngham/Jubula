  <title>Sample 2.2: testing trees</title>
  <para>
    This category contains a Test Case which checks that a tree node
    exists, based on its textpath. Three data sets have been
    entered, which use the variables stored in the previous Test
    Case to complete the textpath.
  </para>
  <para>
    For example, one of the stored variables was
    <emphasis>CATEGORY1</emphasis>. The textpath to test is entered
    as <literal>Category/${CATEGORY1}</literal>.
