    <emphasis role="strong">GUI</emphasis><emphasis>dancer</emphasis>/Jubula are tools for the automated testing of Graphical
    User Interfaces. The focus of the tool is on testing an
    application’s business logic (workflows, use cases) from the user
    perspective (functional, black-box, acceptance testing).

    The approach used is the keyword-driven method. Tests are automated
    by dragging and dropping pre-defined modules (or Test Cases, or
    keywords) to make sequences of actions for your application. Each
    Project contains one or more libraries of these pre-defined modules
    for you to use. Test automation with these keywords is hierarchical
    – using the libraries, you can create modules of your own and reuse
    them to make more complex tests and so on.

  <para>
    Using the keyword-driven approach has various advantages, which are
    detailed in the next <xref linkend="our-approach"/>.
