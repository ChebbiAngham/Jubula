  <title>How to read this manual</title>
  <para>
    We have designed this tool to make testing easier and faster.
    However, it is a powerful application, and some of its features
    are quite sophisticated. We therefore recommend having a look at
    this manual. You can also access the manual from within the ITE by
    pressing <emphasis role="input">»F1«</emphasis>.
  </para>
  <para>
    In the reference manual, you will find information on more
    technical aspects, such as a description of the supported
    components and actions. The reference manual is also shown in the
    context-sensitive help when you press
    <emphasis role="input">»F1«</emphasis>.
