\app{} is based on the \bxname{Eclipse} development platform,  a
 platform-independent, open-source framework for developing applications. 

With the \ite{}, you can specify, modify, execute and analyse tests. 
The user interface offers various ways of working with \app{}, so that you can choose the way that suits you best. You can alter the way the client looks, and the way it behaves. You can work using the menu bar, the tool bar, context-sensitive menus and shortcuts.  

The important thing to remember is that \app{} lets you work the way \emph{you} want to.
