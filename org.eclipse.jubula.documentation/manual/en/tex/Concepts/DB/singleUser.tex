If you work on a single-user database, only one tester can  work on a specific \gdproject{} at a time. 
This also applies to the test executor -- the \ite{} and the test executor cannot access a single-user database at the same time.

This method reduces the complexity of the system and its configuration, 
and should really only be used for demo purposes. 
\gdproject{} sharing remains possible, however, through import/export.
