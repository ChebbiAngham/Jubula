\index{Test Case!Locked}
\index{Locked!Test Case}

When using a multi-user database, multiple testers
 can work on a single \gdproject{} concurrently.

Within such a scenario, all testers currently working on a \gdproject{}
 may view and execute all parts of it.
As soon as one tester alters  a part of the \gdproject{},
 a lock is placed on that unit to disallow other users from making
 changes of their own. They are, however, still able to view and execute
 a locked test unit.
Once the user with the lock has saved all changes, the lock is removed, and the test unit is once again available for editing.

This database scenario is well-suited for larger testing operations, 
allowing for tight collaboration among testers and
 reducing the overall time needed to specify complex testing projects.
