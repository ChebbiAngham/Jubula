Top-down testing  is (at least initially) a more intuitive method of specification. 
To specify a test top-down, you follow the steps in the same way as if you were carrying out the test yourself. 
Each \gdstep{} is specified for the current purpose, and contains all the necessary details (e.g. data). 

The possible problem with this method is that similar or identical parts are 
often separately and multiply specified, which means that making 
changes at a later point
can be difficult and time-consuming.
