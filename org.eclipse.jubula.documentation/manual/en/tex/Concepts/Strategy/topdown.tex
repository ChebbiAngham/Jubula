It is often initially more intuitive to start writing a test in a linear fashion, adding steps as necessary. Each step is specified for the current purpose, and contains all the necessary details (e.g. data). 

The possible problem with this method is that similar or identical parts are 
often separately and multiply specified, which means that making 
changes at a later point
can be difficult and time-consuming.

To avoid this, \app{} lets you extract \gdcases{} from other \gdcases{} to combine them into reusable modules \bxpref{TasksEditorExtract}.
