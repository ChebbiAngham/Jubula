\index{AUT Agent}
The \gdagent{} is the link between your specified tests and the \gdaut{}. 
Once the \gdagent has started the \gdaut{}, object mapping can take place, and tests can be observed and executed.  

You can install the \gdagent on the same machine as the client or on any other machine in the network, as long as the \gdaut{} can also run on the machine. The \gdagent can even run on a different platform than  the client{}. 

This separation
of the client and \gdagent means that you don't have to sacrifice  control of your  machine during test execution.
It also means that you can test your \gdaut{} on different systems using the same test, and from the same client.
