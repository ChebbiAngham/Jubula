You can install the \ite{}  on any machine in the network, and then install the \gdagent on various other machines in the network. 

Within the \ite{}, you can define configurations for your \gdaut{}. The configurations specify where \app{} should look for the \gdaut{} jar or exe file, the JRE binary etc., and on which machine it should look.

\app{} lets you specify different \gdagent{} hosts and port numbers to connect to.
