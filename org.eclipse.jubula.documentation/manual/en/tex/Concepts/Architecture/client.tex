\index{Client}
The \gdclient{} is the interface between you and the \gdaut{}. It provides you with browsers to see \gdcases{} and \gdsuites{}, and editors to modify them.  

In the client, you specify your tests without any programming. \gd{} lets you write tests modularly, structure them to fit your needs, and easily change them to follow developments in the \gdaut{}.
