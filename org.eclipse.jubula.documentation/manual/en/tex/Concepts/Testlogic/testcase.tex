\index{Test Case}
\label{testcase} 

\gdcases{} are a level up from \gdsteps{} in the test hierarchy. They are the building blocks or keywords from which other \gdcases{} and \gdsuites{} are made. They are the reusable elements of \gd{}. 

A \gdcase{} can contain any number of \gdsteps{} and other
 \gdcases{} nested to any depth. \gdcases{} are given user-defined names.  

\gd{}'s design allows \gdcases{} to be reused -- in other \gdcases{} and in \gdsuites{}. There are no limits on how often a \gdcase{} can be reused, as long as no  circular 
dependencies (infinite loops) are created.
