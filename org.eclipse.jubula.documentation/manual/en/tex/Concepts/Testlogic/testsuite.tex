\index{Test Suite}
\label{testsuite}

\gdsuites{} are the containers for \gdcases{} to be executed and can contain as many \gdcases{} as  necessary. 
Each \gdsuite{}  must be bound to one \gdaut{} which it will test. An \gdaut{} can be bound to more than one \gdsuite{}.  

 
An important feature of \jb{}{} is the ability to test a program modularly.
Program parts can be tested as and when they 
are delivered using the specific \gdsuites{} for each part. Only the chosen
\gdsuite{} in a project will be executed, which means that 
testing can begin whether all program components are available/functional
 or not.
