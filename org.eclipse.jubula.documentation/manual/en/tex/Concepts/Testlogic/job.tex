\gdjobs{} are the containers for \gdsuites{} which are to be executed in a sequence. A \gdjob{} can contain \gdsuites{} which test different \gdauts{} or different instances of the same \gdaut{} (with some restrictions, see the previous section \bxpref{TasksSwitchAUT} for details). Each \gdsuite{} in a \gdjob{} is bound to an \gdaut{} and specifies which \gdaut{} it will test based on the \gdaut{} ID.
