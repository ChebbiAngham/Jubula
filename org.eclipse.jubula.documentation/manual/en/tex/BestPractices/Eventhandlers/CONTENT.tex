By using \gdehandlers{} in the right way, you can ensure that your FULLTEST will run through all of its use cases, even if errors occur in the individual use cases. 

You can also ensure that you get as much information as possible about the error, and where it happened. 

The following sections deal with two uses of \gdehandlers{}. First of all, an error handling strategy for the whole test is explained. This strategy can be used for any \gdproject{}. The second section deals with \gdehandlers{} on individual \gdcases{} to deal with local (expected) errors
