\gdsuite{} names should not contain any special characters or spaces. As \gdsuites{} are entered via the command line client, it is important to have names that are easy to enter into a command line under any system. 

The \app{} team uses four main types of \gdsuite{} to execute their tests, \bxname{FULLTEST}, \bxname{FULLTEST\_BROKEN}, \bxname{TICKET\_<NUMBER>} and \bxname{WORK\_<INITIAL>}. The function of these \gdsuites is explained in the section on structuring \gdsuites{} \bxpref{BPKeywordSuites}.
