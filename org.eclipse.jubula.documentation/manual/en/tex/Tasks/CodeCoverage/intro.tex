The \ite{} is integrated with the \bxname{JaCoCo} code coverage tool for Java applications to let you run and analyze code coverage for your tests. 

%You can select \bxname{JaCoCo} as the code coverage agent in the \gdaut{} Configuration \bxpref{CCConfigure} or you can add your own code coverage agent via extension points \bxpref{CCExtension}.

\bxwarn{Code coverage is only available for \gdauts{} started via an \gdaut{} configuration \bxpref{configuringaut} (i.e. not using the \bxname{autrun} command), and which use Java 1.5 or higher.}
