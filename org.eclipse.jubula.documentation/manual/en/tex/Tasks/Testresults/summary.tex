\gd{} stores a test result summary and full details about the whole test for each test run. Individual \gdsuites{} within a \gdjob{} are counted as one test run each. 

You can see the test result summaries in the \gd{} reporting perspective, in the \gdtestsummaryview{}. 

\subsubsection{Re-opening the test result view for a test run}
\label{TasksReopenTestResult}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the full details for a test run are still available (the column \bxname{Details} shows \bxname{true}), you can re-open the full test result by double-clicking on the entry in the \gdtestsummaryview{} or by clicking the button to open the report in the top right-hand corner of the view. 
\item In the test result, you can navigate through the test results using the mouse or using the toolbar buttons to spring to the next or previous error. In this way, you can view any screenshots in the \gdimgview{} and details about errors in the \gdpropview{}.
\end{enumerate}
\bxtipp{In the \gdproject{} properties, you can specify how often the full reports should be automatically deleted from the \gddb{} \bxpref{ProjPropertiesGeneral}. }

\subsubsection{Filtering and sorting in the \gdtestsummaryview{}}
