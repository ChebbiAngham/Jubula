The \gd{} BIRT reports are shown in an integrated BIRT report viewer. 

If you have a BIRT report viewer elsewhere (e.g. in a Tomcat server), then you can put the templates and the library into the external BIRT viewer on the server and view them without starting \gd{}. 

For information on viewing BIRT reports in external viewers, please consult the BIRT documentation.
