\app{} has a complete extension mechanism to allow you to add new components and new actions to use in your tests. The \bxname{Extension Manual} provides more information on this. 

However, it is often the case that you do not (yet) require fully featured support for a component. In many cases, just being able to click the component or check that it exists will suffice. This basic support for new components can be added directly in \app{}.
