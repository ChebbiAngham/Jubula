If your \gdaut{} has components in it that cannot be mapped when in the \gdomm{} \bxpref{TasksOMCollect}, then you can add basic support for them in the \gdproject{} properties in the \bxname{Extension} page. 

\bxtipp{In Swing \gdauts{}, the component to be added must be of the type \bxname{JComponent}. In SWT and RCP \gdauts{}, the component must be of the type \bxname{Control}. This mechanism is not currently supported for HTML \gdauts{}. }

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In the \bxname{Component Extension} page in the \gdproject{} properties, click \bxcaption{Add} to add a new extension.
  \item In the dialog that appears, enter the class name for the component you wish to support (e.g. \bxname{javax.swing.JSeparator} 
  and click \bxcaption{OK}. 
  \item You will now be able to map the component from your \gdaut{}.
\end{enumerate}

\bxtipp{You will be able to perform actions on this component that are performable on components of the type \bxname{Graphics Component}. 
Actions include clicking the component, waiting for it, checking its existence, focus and properties. If you require other actions, then you will have to write a full extension for the component.}

\bxwarn{You will not be able to record actions on this component when in the observation mode.}
