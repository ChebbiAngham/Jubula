The \gdsearchresultview{} shows any items found during a search -- either via the search dialog or the \bxcaption{Show where used} action.

From the \gdsearchresultview{}, you can:

\begin{itemize}
\item Double-click on an item to open its editor. 
\item Re-run the search using the button in the top right-hand corner of the view. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Using search results to make wide-reaching changes to your \gdproject{}}
\label{TasksSearchResultActions}

Once you have performed a search, you can perform specific actions on the results:
\begin{itemize}
\item You can replace a \gdcase{} at multiple places where it has been reused with another \gdcase{} \bxpref{TasksSearchResultReplaceTC}.
\item You can change the column of a central test data set used by any \gdcases{} that use this central test data set \bxpref{TasksChangeCTDSColumn}.
\end{itemize}
