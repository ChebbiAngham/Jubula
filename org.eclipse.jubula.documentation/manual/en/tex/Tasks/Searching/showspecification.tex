To find the the original specification of any reused \gdcase{} or \gdsuite{}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Single-click the \gdcase{} or \gdsuite{} whose specification you want to find.
\item Right-click on the \gdcase{} or \gdsuite{} and select \bxcaption{Show specification} from the context-sensitive menu. You can also press \bxkey{F6} to show the specification.
\item The originally specified  \gdcase{} or \gdsuite{} will be highlighted in the \gdtestcasebrowser{} or \gdtestsuitebrowser{}. 
\item You can open the specified \gdcase{} or \gdsuite{} automatically by selecting \bxcaption{Open specification} or by  pressing \bxkey{F3}.
\item If you double-click the \gdcase{} or \gdsuite{} while it is in an editor, then this will also open the original specification (as if you had pressed \bxkey{F3}).
\bxtipp{\gdcases{} and \gdsuites{} that are not visible due to active filters in the browser are not displayed when show specification is used. You can, however, use \bxname{open specification} to directly open a filtered \gdcase{} or \gdsuite{}.}
\end{enumerate}
