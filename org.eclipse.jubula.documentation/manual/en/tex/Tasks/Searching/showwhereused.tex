To find the places where you have reused a \gdcase{} or a \gdsuite{}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  In a browser or an editor, right-click on the \gdcase{} or \gdsuite{} whose places of reuse  you want to find. You must have selected the parent (original specification) for the action to be enabled.
\item Select \bxcaption{show where reused} from the context sensitive menu. You can also press \bxkey{F7} to show the places where a \gdcase{} or \gdsuite{} has been reused.
\item In the \bxcaption{Search Result View} \bxpref{TasksSearchResultView}, a list of places will appear. These are the places where the \gdcase{} or \gdsuite{} has been reused. 
\item Double-click on an icon in the view to highlight and open the place of reuse.
\item  If you are using this option on a \gdcase{} and want to replace the \gdcase{} you searched for with another \gdcase{} at some or all of the places where it is reused, you can start this action from the  \gdsearchresultview{} \bxpref{TasksSearchResultReplaceTC}.
\end{enumerate}
\bxtipp{If you select this option on a nested \gdcase{}, you will be shown the other places where the \gdcase{} is nested. To see where its parent \gdcase{} is used, you must then carry out the same steps on the parent.}
