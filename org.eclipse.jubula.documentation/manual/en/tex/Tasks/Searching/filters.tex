\subsubsection{Text filters}

The \gdtestcasebrowser{}, the \gdtestsuitebrowser{}, the \gdcompnamebrowser{} and the \gdomeditor{} (in the tree view) all contain a filter area at the top. You can enter a filter text into this area to show matches to the text in the browser or editor. Use star (*) as a wildcard. 

In the \gdtestcasebrowser{}, the \gdcompnamebrowser{} and the \gdtestsuitebrowser{}, the names of the items in the browser are  considered for the filter.

In the \gdomeditor{}, the names and \emph{types} of the components are considered for the filter. 


\subsection{Other filter options}

Some browsers offer pre-defined filters in the top right-hand corner.

In the \gdcompnamebrowser{}, you have the following options:

\begin{itemize}
\item Sort by name or by type
\item Hide component names from reused \gdprojects{}.
\end{itemize}

In the \gdtestcasebrowser{}, you can also show any unused \gdcases{}. 
\bxtipp{We recommend using this filter to refactor or clear up your test.}
