\index{Extracting!Test Case}

\app{} lets you \bxname{extract} \gdcases{} from other \gdcases{} and from \gdsuites{}. This lets you create keywords even after you have started specifying. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the \gdtestcaseeditor{} or \gdtestsuiteeditor{} by double-clicking on the \gdcase{} or \gdsuite{} you  want to edit. 
\item Select the \gdcases{} you want to extract by single-clicking them. Use 
  \bxkey{Ctrl} to select more than one item. 
\item Right-click in the editor and  select: \\
\bxmenu{Refactor}{Extract Test Case}{}.
\item When prompted, enter a name for the new \gdcase{}. 
\item The \gdcases{} you selected will be extracted into this new \gdcase{}. 
\item The extracted \gdcase{} appears as a reused \gdcase{} in the current editor. It is marked with a small arrow to show that it is reused, and the \gdcase{} name is in angled brackets (\bxshell{< >}) to show that it is the same as the specification name. 
\item The \gdcase{} you just created is also visible in the \gdtestcasebrowser{}. 
\end{enumerate}
\bxtipp{Use this feature when you realize that you are planning on reusing one or more \gdcases{} for the same or a similar action again. You will save yourself time in test creation and maintenance.}
