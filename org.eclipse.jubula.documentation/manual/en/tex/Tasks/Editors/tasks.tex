\index{Add!Task ID}
\index{Task ID!Add}

You can add a Task ID to a \gdcase{}, \gdsuite{} or \gdjob{} in the relevant editor.  You can add a task ID to the  item itself, but not to other items used in it (unless you edit them in their own editor). 


\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the editor for the item you want to add a task ID to. 
\item Enter a task ID in the \bxname{Task ID} field in the  \gdpropview{}. 
\item Save the changes
\item Task IDs cannot be overwritten when an item is reused.
\end{enumerate}
