\index{Rename!Referenced Test Case}
\index{Rename!Referenced Test Suite}

You can rename items referenced in \gdcases{}, \gdsuites{} and \gdjobs{}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the editor containing the items you want to rename.
\item Select the item you want to rename in the editor.
\item In the \gdpropview{}, enter the new name for the item in the \bxname{Reference Name} field at the top of the \gdpropview{}. 
\item Save the editor.

The angled brackets from the item  you just edited will disappear from the name in the editor. This indicates that the item has been renamed here. You will still see the original item name behind the new name in brackets. In the preferences, you can opt not to see the original name when you have renamed an item \bxpref{gdprefs}. 

The original item in the browser still has its original name. The referenced item you just renamed will keep its new name even if you rename the original item. 

If you want to reset the original specification name,  empty the \bxname{Reference Name} field and save the editor. The item will redisplay the angled brackets and will have the same name as the specification name.
\end{enumerate}
