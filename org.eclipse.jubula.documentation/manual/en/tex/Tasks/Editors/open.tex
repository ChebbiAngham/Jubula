To open an existing \gdcase{}, \gdsuite{} or \gdjob{} in an editor, you can either double-click the item you want to open in its browser or you can select:\\
\bxmenu{Open With}{... Editor}{}\\
from the context-sensitive menu for the item. 

\bxtipp{If you double-click on an item in a browser that is reused in another item (e.g. you double-click a \gdcase{} that is reused in another \gdcase{}), the editor for its direct parent will open, and the item you double-clicked is selected.}

You can also open an existing \gdcase{} without having to select it from the \gdtestcasebrowser{} using the \bxname{Open Test Case} dialog \bxpref{TasksOpenExistingTC}.
