You have two options to view the \gdomeditor{} - a split view and a tree view. Each view displays the same information, but in a different format. Depending on the view you choose, you can carry out different actions.  

\textbf{The split view}\\
This view is automatically shown when the \gdomeditor{} is opened. It contains three panels for the three main categories. In the split view, you can:
\begin{itemize}
\item Assign (map) technical names to component names \bxpref{TasksOMMap} by dragging component names onto technical names (either assigned or unassigned). 
\bxtipp{The split view is especially useful if you have many mappings -- it lets you find component names and technical names separately to map them, without having to scroll through the whole tree.}
\item Create new component names for your tests \bxpref{TasksCreateNewCompName}.
\item Rename component names \bxpref{TasksRenameCompName}. 
%\item Merge component names \bxpref{TasksMergeCompName}
\item Create categories and map into them \bxpref{omcats}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The tree view}\\
In the tree view, you can:
\begin{itemize}
\item Assign (map) technical names to component names \bxpref{TasksOMMap} by dragging component names onto technical names (either assigned or unassigned). 
\item Create new component names for your tests \bxpref{TasksCreateNewCompName}.
\item Rename component names \bxpref{TasksRenameCompName}. 
%\item Merge component names \bxpref{TasksMergeCompName}
\item Create categories and map into them \bxpref{omcats}.
\end{itemize}
