\index{Property Information!Object Mapping}

When you collect a component from a Swing, SWT/RCP or JavaFX \gdaut{} in the \gdomm{} \bxpref{TasksOMCollect}, you can see additional information on the properties for that component in the \gdpropview{}. 

The property information shows you which properties the component has, and their values. If a property is not accessible, you will see a notice informing you of this. 

You can use this information to help you write tests that use the actions \bxname{check property} and \bxname{store property}. 

The property information is not saved when the \gdomeditor{} is saved: to view property information again, you must collect the component in the \gdomm{} again. 

\bxtipp{Property information can be transient, i.e. it can change as the component or \gdaut{} changes. To make sure that you collect the right property, collect the component when it is in the state that you want it to have. A simple example is the color of a component: if you have a component can be  green or red and you want to check that it is red, then you should collect it while it is red to see the correct property. }
