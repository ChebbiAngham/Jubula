\index{Property Information!Object Mapping}

When you collect a component from a Swing or an SWT/RCP \gdaut{} in the \gdomm{} \bxpref{TasksOMCollect}, you can see additional information on the properties for that component in the \gdpropview{}. 

The property information shows you which properties the component has, and their values. If a property is not accessible, you will see a notice informing you of this. 

You can use this information to help you write tests that use the actions \bxname{check property} and \bxname{store property}. 

The property information is not saved when the \gdomeditor{} is saved: to view property information again, you must collect the component in the \gdomm{} again.
