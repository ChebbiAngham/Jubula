\label{Agent}

The \gdagent{} is the server component. It runs on the same machine as the \gdaut{} and allows the \ite{} to communicate with the \gdaut{} and control it during test execution. 
You must be connected to a running \gdagent{} in order to be able to perform object mapping, to observe tests, and to execute tests. 

There are two options for working with an \gdagent{}:

\begin{itemize}
\item You can connect to an embedded \gdagent{} that does not have to be started in advance \bxpref{TasksAgentConnect}. This option is only available if you are starting your \gdaut{} on the same machine as the \ite{}. It can also be used with the test executor: the testexec can start an embedded \gdagent{} for use during the test.
\item You can start an \gdagent{} on a machine (local or remote) and connect to it using the \ite{} or the Test Executor \bxpref{TasksAgentExternal}.
\end{itemize}
