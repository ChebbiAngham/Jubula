You can find the \gddb{} connection preference page under:\\
\bxname{Test-\gddb{} Connections}\\
in the preferences dialog.

When you start the \ite{} for the first time, it is automatically configured to use an embedded \gddb{}. If this is the only \gddb{} configured, then the \gddb{} login is performed automatically. 

In this preference page, you can configure other \gddb{} connections for your productive \gddb{}. 

\bxwarn{We do not recommend using the embedded \gddb{} for productive use.} 


\subsubsection{Adding, editing and removing \gddb{} configurations}

To add a new \gddb{}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item In the \gddb{} Connections preference page, click \bxcaption{Add}.
\item In the dialog that appears, enter a meaningful configuration name.
\item Select the type of \gddb{} that this configuration is for. 
\bxtipp{The \ite{} is thoroughly tested with Oracle. PostGreSQL and MySQL have been successfully tried out, but we cannot guarantee their usage in productive environments.}
\item Based on the \gddb{} type you choose, you must enter more details about the \gddb{} connection. Speak to your \gddb{} administrator if you are unsure of the connection details. 
\end{enumerate}

You can edit and delete \gddb{} configurations using the buttons in the \gddb{} Connections preference page.
