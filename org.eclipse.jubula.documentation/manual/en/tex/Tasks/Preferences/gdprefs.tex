 In the preferences dialog, select \bxname{Test} from the tree on the left hand side.

From this page, you can configure your preferences for:
\begin{description}
\item [Auto-scrolling and -expanding:]{When the checkbox is marked, the views and browsers  automatically scroll in the direction you move the mouse when you are dragging and dropping. Trees will also be automatically expanded when you hover over them while dragging items.}
\item [Minimizing the \ite{}:]{When the checkbox is marked, the \ite{} is automatically minimized when test execution begins. This is useful if you are letting tests run on the same machine you are specifying on.}
\item [\gdaut{} confirmation dialog:]{When the checkbox is marked, a dialog appears to check if you are sure when you click the  \bxcaption{stop \gdaut{}} button.}
\item [Original \gdcase{} name:]{When the checkbox is activated, you can see the original name of a referenced \gdcase{} in brackets behind a new name you enter for the \gdcase{}. This can help you to see and search for \gdcases{} you have reused. }
\item[\gdstep{} information:]{When this checkbox is activated, you see the details about the \gdstep{} (the component name and type, and the action) in square brackets behind the \gdstep{} name. If you do not want to see these details, you can deactivate this checkbox.}
\item[Show referenced children:]{When this option is not active, you can only see  referenced parent \gdcases{} in the \gdtestcasebrowser{}. The referenced \gdcases{} contained in these \gdcases{} are not displayed. This action can be useful if you want to improve the speed of working with the \ite{}.}
\item [\gdproject{} auto load:]{If you have selected a \gdproject{} to be automatically loaded \bxpref{TasksAutoLoadProject}, then you can stop the auto-loading by deactivating the checkbox.}
\item [Switching to the \execpersp{}:]{When the test begins, the \ite{} can automatically change to the \execpersp{}. You can choose to always be asked, to always change, or to never change. }
\item [Data files location:]{You can specify a location where external data files (e.g. Excel files) are held, or use the workspace directory as the base location. }
\bxtipp{The advantage of using the workspace as a location for your data files is that you can view these in the navigator view directly in the \ite{}. Windows users can even open Excel files from the \ite{} using the In-Place editor.}
