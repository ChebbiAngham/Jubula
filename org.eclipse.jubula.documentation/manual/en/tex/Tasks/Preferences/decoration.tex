You can open the label decoration preferences by  selecting \bxname{General - Appearance - Label Decorations} from the preference dialog. 

From this preference page, you can alter your preferences for:
\begin{description}
\item[Completeness Check Decorator:]{ We recommend leaving this decorator active, as it shows you red crosses and tooltips in the \gdtestsuitebrowser{} when \gdsuites{} and \gdjobs{} are incomplete.}
\item[Test Result Duration Decorator:]{Deactivate this option to not see the execution time required for each node in the \gdtestresultview{}. The times shown are for the execution of each node, including its children. You can use this information to see whether specific \gdcases{} are taking longer than you expect them to.}
\item[Test Result Parameter Decorator:]{Deactivate this option to not see the parameter values used at this node (i.e. either entered at this level, or actually used at this place) in the \gdtestresultview{}. You can use this information to easily see which data were used for your \gdcases{}, without having to click through each individual node in the \gdtestresultview{}. This can be especially useful if you have one \gdcase{} that runs multiple times with different datasets. }
