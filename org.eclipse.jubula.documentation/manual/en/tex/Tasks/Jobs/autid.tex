Once you have added a \gdsuite{} to a \gdjob{} \bxpref{TasksEditorAdd}, you must select the \gdaut{} ID that you wish to run this \gdsuite{} on from the \gdpropview{}. 

This enables you to differentiate between multiple \gdauts{} (or instances of the same \gdaut{} in your tests). 

\bxtipp{You must have defined all \gdauts{} to be tested during a \gdjob{} in the \gdaut{} definition dialog \bxpref{Defineaut}.}
