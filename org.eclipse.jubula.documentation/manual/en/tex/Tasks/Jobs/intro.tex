\index{Test Job}

You can create a \gdjob{} when you want to execute a collection of \gdsuites{} after each other. 

The \gdsuites{} can test the same \gdaut{}, different instances of the same \gdaut{}, or different \gdauts{} entirely. 

You do not have to create a \gdjob{} if you only want to run tests on one instance of one \gdaut{}. To do this, you can use a \gdsuite{} \bxpref{WorkingWithSuites}. A \gdjob{} is most useful when you want to switch between two \gdauts{} (either the same \gdaut{} or a different one) in one test run.
