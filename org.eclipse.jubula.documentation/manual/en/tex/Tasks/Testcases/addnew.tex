\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the \gdtestcaseeditor{} by double-clicking on the \gdcase{} you want to edit in the \gdtestcasebrowser{}. 
\item From the context-sensitive menu, select:
\bxmenu{Add}{New \gdcase{}}{}\\
(This places the \gdcase{} after any other items in the \gdtestcaseeditor{}.)
or\\
\bxmenu{Insert}{New \gdcase{}}{}\\
(This places the \gdcase{} above the currently selected item in the \gdtestcaseeditor{}.)

\item In the dialog that appears, enter a meaningful name for the new \gdcase{}. 
\item Click \bxcaption{OK}. 
\item The \gdcase{} appears in the \gdtestcaseeditor{} in the parent  \gdcase{} and also appears in the \gdtestcasebrowser{}.  The \gdcase{} is  marked with a small arrow to show that it is  reused here. The name of the \gdcase{} is contained in angled brackets (\bxshell{< >}) to show that it is the same name that you used when you specified the \gdcase{}. 
\item Save the changes in the editor.
\end{enumerate}
