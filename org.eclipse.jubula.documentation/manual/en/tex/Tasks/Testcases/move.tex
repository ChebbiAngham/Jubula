If you are reusing a \gdproject{} or \gdprojects{} in your currently opened \gdproject{} \bxpref{reuseproject}, you can move \gdcases{} you create to these reused \gdprojects{} to make them a part of that \gdproject{}. 

This lets you add useful \gdcases{} to external libraries to be reused in other \gdprojects{}. 


\begin{enumerate}
\item In the \gdtestcasebrowser{}, select the \gdcase{}, \gdcases{} or categories you want to move to an external \gdproject{} that you are currently reusing in the open \gdproject{}. 
\item Right click on the selected items and select:\\
\bxmenu{Move to external Project}{}{}\\
from the context-sensitive menu. 
\item From the dialog which appears, select which reused \gdproject{} to move them to. 
\item The items you selected will appear in the blue colored category of the reused \gdproject{} you selected and will disappear from their original place. 
\item The structure of your \gdproject{} stays the same -- the moved \gdcases{} are not deleted from places where you have reused them, for example. 
\end{enumerate}
\bxwarn{If you move \gdcases{} containing referenced \gdcases{} from other \gdprojects{}, make sure that the \gdproject{} the \gdcases{} are dependent on is also reused in your external \gdproject{}.}
