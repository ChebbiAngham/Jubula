\gd{} is integrated with the Mylyn \gdproject{} to support task- and context-based work with your tests. 

Mylyn lets you:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduce the amount of \gdcases{} and \gdsuites{} you can see in your \gdproject{} so that you can focus on a task. 
\item Switch between tasks, recreating the context (visible \gdcases{}, open editors) that you had for each task.
\item Connect to repositories such as Eclipse, TRAC etc. to manage tasks and tickets within the whole team. 
\end{itemize}

The Mylyn online help is included in \gd{}. 

Select:\\
 \bxmenu{Help}{Help Contents}{}\\
in the \gd{} client to see the Mylyn help.
