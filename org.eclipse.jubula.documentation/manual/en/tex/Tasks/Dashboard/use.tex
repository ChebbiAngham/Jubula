Once you have started the \dash{} application in your browser \bxpref{TasksDashCustom}, you will see the \reportpersp{} you are familiar with from the \ite{} \bxpref{TestResSumView}.

\subsubsection{Features available in the \dash{}}
Many of the features available for viewing test results in the \ite{} are also available here:
\begin{itemize}
\item You can reopen the \gdtestresultview{}  for a test run whose details are still in the \gddb{} \bxpref{TasksReopenTestResult}.
\item You can refresh the \gdtestsummaryview{} \bxpref{TasksRefreshSummaryView}.
\item You can filter and sort in the \gdtestsummaryview{} \bxpref{TasksFilterTestSummary}.
\item When a test result is open, you can jump to the next or previous error \bxpref{testresultview} and view properties details / any screenshots taken for a selected node. 
\item You can export test results as HTML and XML reports from the \dash{}. 
\end{itemize}
