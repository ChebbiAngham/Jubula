The analyses and metrics can either be run for the whole \gdproject{}, or for specific contexts within the \gdproject{}. 

To run a metric or analysis for the whole \gdproject{}, select the metric or analysis you want to perform from the toolbar button. 

To run a metric or analysis for a specific context, select the context you require (e.g. the top node in the \gdtestcasebrowser{} to perform the metric or analysis just for items within this browser) and then select:\\
\bxmenu{Analyze}{}{}\\
from the context menu, selecting the required option to run. 

Once a metric or analysis has run, the results are shown in the Search Result View.
