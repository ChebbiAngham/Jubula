Regardless of the type of \gdaut{} you want to start, you will always need to enter the following information in the \gdaut{} configuration dialog. 

\begin{itemize}
\item  A suggested name for this \gdaut{} configuration is generated automatically based on your \gdaut{} name and the default \gdagent{} host. You can change this name if you wish. 
\item The default \gdagent host is also automatically selected. You can select a new \gdagent{} from the combo box or add a new one by clicking \bxcaption{New}. For more information on adding and editing an \gdagent{}, see the section later \bxpref{TasksPrefsAgent}.
\item Enter the \gdaut{} ID that will be given to this \gdaut{} when it is started.  
\end{itemize}
