\index{Working Directory}

In some \gdaut{} configuration dialogs, you can optionally create a working directory to store files in. The server directory of the installation is selected as default. To create a working directory elsewhere, browse to and select the location. 

The working directory is the root directory for any classpaths, classnames, JAR files and binaries. If you create a working directory, you can enter the paths to these items using a relative path, with the working directory as the root. For more information on relative paths, read the section later \bxpref{TasksRelativePaths}.
