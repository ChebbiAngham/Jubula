Once you have configured one or more repositories for your workspace \bxpref{}, you can select one of these to be the test-relevant repository for your \gdproject{}. 

This will let you:
\begin{itemize}
\item Add a task ID from this repository to \gdcases{}, \gdsuites{}, and \gdjobs{} in the \gdproject{} to signify that this item is the test for this task \bxpref{TasksALMAddTask}.
\item Automatically report test results to the task defined when a test runs.
\item View the test results for the relevant item in the dashboard as a link from the task repository.
\end{itemize}

To configure a task repository for your \gdproject{}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item In the \gdproject{} Properties, select \bxname{Mylyn ALM} from the tree on the left \bxfigref{TasksALMProjectProperties}.
\item In the page that appears, you can select a repository from the combo-box.
\item You can then choose whether to only report failed tests, only report successful tests, or both.
\item Enter the URL of the \dash{} that is configured to use the correct \gddb{} for your test results. This is the \dash{} that will be opened when you click on a test result link from the task repository.
\end{enumerate}
