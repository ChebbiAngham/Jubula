\index{Modeling}

The \gd{} modeling perspective has been designed to help teams get started with automated testing early on in the development process by allowing the import of UML diagrams and the subsequent generation of \gdcase{} structures from the models. 

Testing early is important to find errors when they are cheaper to fix, yet it is often difficult to know where to start testing or how to structure the tests to be as reusable and maintanable as possible. 

At this stage, it is important to realize that the aim is not to derive complete, functional tests from complex models. Instead, the imported use case diagrams and activity diagrams, and the \gdcases{} generated from them, can be used to see which structures (\gdcases{}) will need to be reused throughout the test, and what sequences of \gdcases{} will need to be created to cover the use cases.
