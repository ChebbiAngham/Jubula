\index{Modeling!Options}


The modeling perspective offers different ways of grouping and visualising your model, as well as useful actions to help you work with the model:

\begin{description}
\item [Zooming:]{You can use the context-sensitive menu and the main menu to zoom into and out of the canvas. }
\item [Printing:]{In the context-sensitive menu for the canvas, you can opt to print the model. In the main menu you can choose to see page breaks in the \gdmodeleditor{}. }
\item [Saving as an image:]{You can save the model as an image file using the context-sensitive menu in the \gdmodeleditor{}. }
\item [Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy and Paste]{ actions are all available in the context-sensitive menu in the \gdmodeleditor{}. }
\item [Arranging:]{You can either arrange the selected items in the \gdmodeleditor{} or arrange all of the items automatically.}
\item [Adding notes:]{You can add notes to the model and to the elements within it. Notes are, however, not generated with the \gdcases{} from the model.}
\end{description}
