\index{Appearance!Model}

There are various ways of altering the appearance of the model and the canvas. 

In the main menu, under the \bxname{Modeling} menu, you can alter details about the fonts, colors and lines as well as choosing whether to show grids and rulers. These options are also available in the \gdpropview{} in the modeling perspective under the \bxname{Appearance} and \bxname{Rulers \& Grid} tabs. 

You can also set appearance features in the preferences for modeling \bxpref{TasksPrefsModel}.
