Once you have activated \bxpref{TeststyleActivate} and configured \bxpref{TeststyleConfigure} Teststyle for a \gdproject{}, you will be informed when your chosen guidelines are not being upheld. The central place for viewing your Teststyle information, warnings and errors is the \gdprobview{}.

For each Teststyle message, you will see an entry in the \gdprobview{}, with the information on where the guideline is not being upheld. You can use the \gdprobview{} to view the rule that has been flouted and also to fix the problem using the Quick Fix option.
