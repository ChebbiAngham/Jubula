Teststyle lets you perform static analysis of your tests to make sure they conform to conventions and best practices. For any guidelines you have set in the \gdproject{}, Teststyle will inform you if they are not being upheld by displaying information, warnings and errors in the \gdprobview{}. Elements in the \gdproject{} where warnings and errors are present are decorated with the yellow warning symbol and the red error cross. 

The Teststyle guidelines available reflect best practices and conventions from working in a variety of \gdprojects{}. They include guidelines on naming conventions to make tests easy to read, easy to incorporate into build processes, structural conventions for your \gdprojects{} and test design guidelines to make tests maintainable and understandable.
