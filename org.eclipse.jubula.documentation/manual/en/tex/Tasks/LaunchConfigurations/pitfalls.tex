\item{Breakpoints may alter the timing of tests. This can have consequences 
      such as timeouts, tests failing when they should succeed, and tests 
      succeeding when they should fail.}
\item Actions that affect the lifecycle of the \gdaut{} such as restarting it cannot be used in tests that use an \gdaut{} started via a launch configuration.
