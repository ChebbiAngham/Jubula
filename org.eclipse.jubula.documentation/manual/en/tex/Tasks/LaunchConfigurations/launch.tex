The \bxname{Start \gdaut{}} button can be used, just like the \bxname{Run} or 
\bxname{Debug} buttons, to launch an application or configure application 
launches. Applications started in this way are always started in debug mode.
Furthermore, \bxname{Start \gdaut{}} adds additional information to the 
launch process, allowing the started application to be tested by \app{}.
\gdmarpar{../../../share/PS/startAUT}{Start \gdaut{}}

Some of the additional information that makes the started application testable 
can be configured from the \bxname{Test} tab of the 
\bxname{Start \gdaut{} Configurations} dialog.

\index{AUT ID}
The \textbf{\gdaut{} ID} can be assigned or left blank. If left blank, the
configuration name (ex. \bxname{New\_configuration}) will be used.
