Although the automatic \gdagent{} selection generally selects the correct
\gdagent{}, it can be useful to know what criteria go into the selection 
process. These rules are followed when deciding with which \gdagent{} the 
starting \gdaut{} should be registered:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{If the \ite{} is currently connected to an \gdagent{}, then that 
	  \gdagent{} will be used.}
\item{If an embedded \gdagent{} is running, the \ite{} will connect to the embedded \gdagent{} and use that for \gdaut{} registration.}
\item{An embedded \gdagent{} will be started, and the connection will be made and used for \gdaut{} registration.}
\end{enumerate}
