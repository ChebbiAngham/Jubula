Although \app{}'s automatic \gdagent{} selection generally selects the correct
\gdagent{}, it can be useful to know what criteria go into the selection 
process. \app{} follows these rules when deciding with which \gdagent{} the 
starting \gdaut{} should be registered:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{If \app{} is currently connected to an \gdagent{}, then that 
	  \gdagent{} will be used.}
\item{If an embedded \gdagent{} is running, then \app{} will connect to the embedded \gdagent{} and use that for \gdaut{} registration.}
\item{\app{} will start an embedded \gdagent{}, connect to it, and use that for \gdaut{} registration.}
\end{enumerate}
