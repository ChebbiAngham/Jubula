In most cases, the button to start \gdauts{} is not included in the main 
toolbar. The following steps describe how to add this button to a 
Perspective's toolbar:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Select: \\
\bxmenu{Window}{Customize Perspective...}{}\\
from the main menu.} 
\item{In the dialog that appears, select the \bxname{Command Groups Availability} tab.}
\item{Ensure that the entry \bxname{Start \gdaut{}} in the section 
    \bxname{Available command groups:} is checked.}
\item{Close the dialog by pressing the \bxname{OK} button.}
\end{enumerate}

Once you have completed the steps listed above, the \bxname{Start \gdaut{}} button 
should be visible in the main toolbar of the active Perspective.
\gdmarpar{../../../share/PS/startAUT}{Start \gdaut{}}
