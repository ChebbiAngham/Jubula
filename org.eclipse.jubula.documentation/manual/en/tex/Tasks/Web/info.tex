The \app{} components and actions also work on HTML \gdauts{}. Please bear the following information in mind when testing HTML \gdauts{}:

\begin{itemize}
\item In the current version, Frames and IFrames are not supported.
\item Some of the \app{} actions in the \bxname{concrete} toolkit (i.e. which are theoretically valid for all \gdaut{} types) may not (yet) be supported. In some cases, this is because the component doesn't exist as such in HTML \gdauts{} (menu bars for example). 
\item The \bxname{gdrun} option to start \gdauts{} \bxpref{gdrun} cannot be used for HTML \gdauts{}. 
\item Unlike other toolkits supported by \app{}, real clicks and key events are not sent to HTML \gdauts{}. We have, however, made sure that only actions which would be possible for a user can be completed by \app{}.
\end{itemize}
