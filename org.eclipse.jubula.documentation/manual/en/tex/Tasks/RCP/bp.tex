One of the features of RCP \gdauts{} is that they generally remember the state of the \gdaut{} (position of views, which perspective was open) when the \gdaut{} is closed. In order to make tests as robust as possible, we recommend starting each use case with a module to reset the perspective to its defaults, and testing with this default perspective.
