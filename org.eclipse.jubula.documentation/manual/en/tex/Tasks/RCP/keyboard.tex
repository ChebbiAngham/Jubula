\index{Keyboard Layout}

For RCP \gdauts{}, a keyboard layout must be entered in the \gdaut{} configuration \bxpref{AdvancedAUTConfig}. \jb{} installs German (DE) and English (US) as standard keyboard layouts. 

If you require a different keyboard layout, you must create a mapping file for the new language \bxextref{\jb{}efman}{ref,keyboardlayout} and place it in the server/resources directory. You also have to put this mapping file into the RCP-Accessor plug-in of your \gdaut{}:\\
