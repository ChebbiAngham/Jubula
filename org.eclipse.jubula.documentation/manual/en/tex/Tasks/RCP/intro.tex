You can write tests for RCP \gdauts{} by selecting the toolkit \bxname{concrete} or \bxname{RCP} from the \gdproject{} properties. If you will need to test RCP-specific components (such as toolbars with drop-down menus, or tree-tables), you will need to select \bxname{RCP} as the toolkit for the \gdproject{}. 

The GEF toolkit is a subset of the \bxname{RCP} toolkit and is described in a later section \bxpref{geftest}.
