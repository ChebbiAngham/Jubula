\gdhelpid{guidancerPropertiesViewContextId}{Properties View}
\begin{itemize}
\item The data source changes automatically to reflect the new data source when you enter an Excel file, a Central Test Data Set or when you enter new data in the \gdcase{}. 
\item To change the data set back to the original specification data (\bxname{referenced \gdcase{}}), first remove all Excel files or Central Test Data Sets, then change the data source in the combo box back to \bxname{referenced \gdcase{}}.
\end{itemize}
