The GEF toolkit is a sub-toolkit of RCP. To be able to test \gdauts{} that contain GEF components, you must select \bxname{RCP} as the toolkit in the \gdproject{} properties. 

The same points about the RCP Remote Control plugin and the keyboard files mentioned in the section on RCP \gdauts{} \bxpref{rcpaut} are also valid for testing \gdauts{} with GEF components. 

Testing GEF components is a little different to testing other components in \app{}, because we highly recommend that the software developers use our accessibility plug-in in the \gdaut{} to make the testing of GEF components more robust.
