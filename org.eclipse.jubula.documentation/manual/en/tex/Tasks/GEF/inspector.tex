The GEF \gdinspector in  the \jb{} client allows you to collect information about the textpath to an item from within your RCP \gdaut{}. For many of the actions on GEF figures, you will need to know the textpath. Using the \jb{} accessibility plug-in will mean that the textpaths will be easier to read without the inspector \bxpref{gefaccess}. 

To use the inspector, you must have started the \gdaut{} \bxpref{startaut}. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the GEF \gdinspector if it is not already open via:\\
\bxmenu{Window}{Show View}{Other}
\item In the \gdinspector, select the \gdaut{} you want to inspect in from the drop-down menu next to the \bxname{activate inspector} button.
\item In your \gdaut{}, you will see a blue marking over items you can inspect in the canvas. 
\item Click on an item to inspect it.
\item In the GEF \gdinspector{}, the path to the item will be shown. If the code for your \gdaut{} uses the accessibility code from \jb{}, then the textpath will be less complex and more readable. 
\item You can copy the textpath from the \gdinspector and paste it as a parameter in your \gdcases{}. 
\bxtipp{You will need to activate the inspector for each item you want to inspect}
\end{enumerate}
