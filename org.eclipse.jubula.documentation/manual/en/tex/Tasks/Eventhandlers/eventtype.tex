\label{eventtype}

The event type is the type of error the \gdehandler{} will react to. 
There are four event types. They correspond to common errors which happen during test execution. 

\begin{description}
\item [Component not found]{If a component in the \gdaut{} cannot be found, an error occurs. The component might not be found if it has been changed, is not (yet) visible or has been deleted. }
\item [Check failed]{For some actions, you can specify an expected value to check. If the value you specify is not true, then a \bxname{check failed} error occurs.} 
\item [Action error]{Action errors occur when an action cannot be carried out on a component, when the data is invalid (e.g. an invalid menu path) or when an action takes too long and there is a timeout.}
\item [Configuration error]{Configuration errors occur when there is an internal problem, for example a changed implementation class in the XML file. }
