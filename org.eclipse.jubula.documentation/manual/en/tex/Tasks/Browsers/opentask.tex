Each \gdcase{}, \gdsuite{} and \gdjob{}  in a \gdproject{} can be joined to a task in an external repository via a task ID \bxpref{TasksALM}. You can open the task for an item from the browser:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Select the item whose task you want to open in the browser.
\item Right click and select:\\
\bxmenu{Open with}{Mylyn Task Editor}{}
\item The task from the external repository will open in the \ite{}.
\end{enumerate}
\bxwarn{If no repository has been defined for the \gdproject{}, or the task ID does not exist, or the repository is not configured in the workspace, then the task will not open.}
