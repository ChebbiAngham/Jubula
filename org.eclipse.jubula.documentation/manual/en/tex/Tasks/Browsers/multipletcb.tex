\index{Test Case Browser!Opening multiple times}

To make navigation in larger \gdprojects{} easier, you can open multiple instances of the \gdtestcasebrowser{}. You can filter each \gdtestcasebrowser{} separately to give you different views of your \gdcases{} at the same time. All instances of the \gdtestcasebrowser{} are kept up-to-date with any changes to \gdcases{} in the \gdproject{}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item To open a new \gdtestcasebrowser{}, select \bxname{New Test Case Browser} from the small arrow menu in the \gdtestcasebrowser{}. A new \gdtestcasebrowser{} will open.
\item When you have multiple browsers open, one of them will always be marked as the main browser in its title. This is the default browser for actions such as \bxcaption{Show Specification} and for the displaying of any search results. You can switch the main browser using the button in the toolbar. If you close the \gdtestcasebrowser{} you have marked as being the main browser, another \gdtestcasebrowser{} will automatically be marked as the new main browser.
\end{enumerate}
