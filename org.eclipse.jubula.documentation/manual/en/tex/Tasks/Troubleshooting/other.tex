\index{Locked!Test Case}

If you are working in a multi-user environment, or if you are working on multiple editors at once, \jb{} may lock the editors. This is to secure the editors so that conflicting changes do not take place. You will be able to save changes in your editor once the changes by the other tester or in the other editor have been saved. 

After an irregular shutdown, you may find that some editors may still be locked. This is temporary and will pass.
