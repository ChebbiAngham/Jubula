\textbf{Green border does not appear in Java \gdauts{}}\\
If you are in the \gdomm{}  and cannot see a green border around components, then this could mean the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The border cannot be drawn -- try collecting the component anyway and see if the technical name appears in the \gdomeditor{}. 
\item The component is not supported -- find out whether the component in your \gdaut{} is a standard component or a custom component. If it is a custom component, you may need to extend \app{} to be able to test it. 
%% A simple mechanism for adding basic support is available directly in the \gdproject{} settings \bxpref{TasksBasicExtension}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Green border is shown but component cannot be mapped}\\
If you can see the green border in the \gdomm{} but cannot collect the component, this could mean the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item The key combination you are using is being blocked by the \gdaut{} -- try changing the combination \bxpref{TasksPrefsOMM}.
\item The component is already mapped. Check whether a technical name in the \bxname{unassigned technical names} or \bxname{assigned names} category is being highlighted.
\item The component is not supported -- find out whether the component in your \gdaut{} is a standard component or a custom component. If it is a custom component, you may need to extend \app{} to be able to test it.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Problems with GTK}\\
The GTK graphics toolkit (often used with Linux) can make object mapping with the default \app{} settings impossible for certain components. If the \gdaut{} that you are mapping is running under Linux, please change the object mapping shortcut key combination to anything \emph{other than} \bxkey{Ctrl+Shift+[0-9 or A-F]}.
