\index{Support Package}


If you have found a problem with the \ite{} itself, you can create a support information package from  within the \ite{}. You can choose which information to include in the package, which can be uploaded to a bug-tracking system as a .zip file.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Select:\\
\bxmenu{Help}{Create Support Information Package}{}
\item In the dialog which appears, select what to add to the package: 
\begin{description}
\item [Configuration information:]{This includes information about how you have configured the \ite{}, which other plugins you are using, and information about your environment. }
\item [The \gdagent{} log]{This lets us see the messages from the \gdagent{}. If you are not connected to the \gdagent{}, this option will be grayed out. }
\item [The client log]{This lets us see the messages from the \ite{}. }
\item [The \gdproject{} and depending \gdprojects{}]{The currently open \gdproject{} and any \gdprojects{} it reuses.}
\end{description}
\item Browse to the destination to save the .zip file.
\item Click \bxcaption{OK}. 
\item The prepared package will be saved to the destination you specified.
\end{enumerate}
