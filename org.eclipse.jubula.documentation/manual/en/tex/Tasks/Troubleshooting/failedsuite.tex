\index{Test Suite!Failed}
If your test fails, you can find exact details about the problem by looking at the \gdtestresultview{} \bxpref{testresultview}. A screenshot of the \gdaut{} is automatically taken when an error occurs and can be seen in the \gdimgview{}.

For other problems with test execution, check:

\begin{itemize}
\item That the \gdaut{} is in focus and is visible. You can automatically activate the \gdaut{} in the \gdaut{} properties \bxpref{configuringaut} or you can use a \gdcase{} to activate the \gdaut{}. You can also set your preferences to minimize the \ite{} when test execution begins \bxpref{gdprefs}. 
\bxwarn{Bear in mind that different platforms have different focus behavior. You may need to specifically bring the \gdaut{} into focus by clicking into it as a part of the test.}
\item That the \gdaut{} is ready when the test begins. To ensure this, you can insert a \gdcase{} at the beginning of each test which waits for the window or for the first component you want to test. This is especially important when you are running tests from the command line with the Test Executor. 

\bxtipp{Waiting for a window to appear is generally a good idea whenever a new window or dialog is opened during the test. Waiting for the window or the component you want to test will make sure that your tests run even under different timing conditions.  }
\item Make sure that the \gdcases{} and \gdsteps{} are in the right order.
\item Ensure that the data you have entered is correct.
\item Check your object mapping configuration \bxpref{TasksOMConfiguration}. We recommend that you set the recognition to \bxcaption{standard}.
\item If the \gdaut{} is an RCP application, make sure that the keyboard layout is correct \bxpref{configuringaut}. Otherwise, make sure you have the current version of the RCP Remote Control plugin (start your application with -clean to be sure).  
\item Check that the \gdsteps{} preceding the failed \gdstep{} were successful by looking at the state of the application.  
\end{itemize}
\bxtipp{To help you analyze the reasons for \gdsuite{} failure, you can use the \bxname{pause on error} option \bxpref{TasksPauseOnError}.}
