\textbf{If the start \gdaut{} button is disabled}\\
If you cannot start a particular \gdaut{}, this could be because:

\begin{itemize}
\item You have not connected to the \gdagent \bxpref{connectserv}.
\item You have not defined an \gdaut{} \bxpref{Defineaut}.
\item You have not configured an \gdaut{} \bxpref{configuringaut}.
\item The \gdaut{} does not support the current working language. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Errors starting the \gdaut{}}\\
If there is an error starting the \gdaut{}, this could be because:
\begin{description}
\item [The \gdaut{} cannot be found:]{Make sure that the JAR or executable file for the \gdaut{} is correct, or that the classpaths are correct \bxpref{configuringaut}.}
\item [The main class has not been found:]{Make sure that the JAR file or the classpaths you have entered contain the main class \bxpref{configuringaut}. }
\item[The JAR given as a classpath is not valid:]{Check that you have entered the right JAR file, and that the path to it is correct from this computer. If you have entered a relative path, make sure that it is relative to the \gdaut{} base directory, if there is one, or to the \gdagent directory if you have not specified a \gdaut{} base directory. }
\item[The JAR given as a classpath does not contain a distinct  main 
class:]{Check that you have entered a JAR which contains a main class.}

\end{description}

\textbf{If the \gdaut{} does not appear in the \gdrunautview{}}\\
If the \gdaut{} does not appear in the \gdrunautview{} and you are testing an RCP application, make sure that the RCP Remote Control plugin has been installed \bxpref{rcpaut}. 

Otherwise, check that the toolkit you specified in the \gdaut{} configuration \bxpref{configuringaut} is the right toolkit for this \gdaut{}.
