You can use the dbtool to import, export and delete \gdprojects{} from the \gddb{} in without using the \ite{}. You can also use it to create a new version of a \gdproject{} in the \gddb{}.

This is particularly useful for automated build and test processes, where you may want to automatically export and import \gdprojects{} out of and into version control to run your tests.
