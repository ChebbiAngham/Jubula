You can use the \gd{} \gddb{} tool (GUIdancerDBTool) to import, export and delete \gdprojects{} from the \gddb{} in \gd{} without using the \gd{} client. 

This is particularly useful for automated build and test processes, where you may want to automatically export and import \gdprojects{} out of and into version control to run your tests.
