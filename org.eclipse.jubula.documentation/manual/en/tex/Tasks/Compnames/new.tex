For information on creating new component names by \bxname{reassigning} old component names (in the \gdcompnamesview{} for example, see the section on reassigning component names \bxpref{TasksReassignCompName}. 

You can create new component names in the \gdcompnamebrowser{}  and in the \gdomeditor{} (tree view) via the context menu:\\
\bxmenu{New Component Name}{}{}

\bxtipp{You can also use the toolbar button to create a new component name when you are in the \gdomeditor{}.}

A dialog will appear to allow you to enter a component name. We recommend having good naming conventions for component names, as this will help you when mapping later. 

The component name you enter will be created and will appear in the \bxname{unassigned component names} category in the \gdomeditor{} and in the \bxname{unused component names} category in the \gdcompnamebrowser{}. 

\bxtipp{Newly created component names have the type \bxname{graphics component} until they are made more specific, either by mapping them to a technical name or by entering this new name in the \gdcompnamesview{} for a more concrete component type. }
