Component names are the names you use to refer to the user interface components you want your actions to be executed on. These component names are collected and assigned to real components when you carry out object mapping \bxpref{objectmappingtasks}. 

\bxtipp{A component is an element of the user interface you can execute an action on, e.g. a button, a text field.}

Each component you are planning on testing requires a component name. We recommend using well-thought out names so that object mapping and test creation / maintenance are easier \bxpref{BPComponentNames}.
