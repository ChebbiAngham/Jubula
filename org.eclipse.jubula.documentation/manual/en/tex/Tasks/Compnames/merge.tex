\index{Merge Component Names}

You can merge two or more component names to one unifying name in the \gdomeditor{} (tree view) and in the \gdcompnamebrowser{}. This makes sense if you have accidentally created two component names for the same component. 

\bxtipp{The component types must be the same to be able to merge the component names, and the component names must not have already been mapped to different technical names from the \gdaut{}. The component names must all come from the current \gdproject{}, not from any of the reused \gdprojects{}.}

To merge component names:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Select the component names you want to merge. Use \bxkey{CTRL} to select multiple names. 
\item From the context-menu, select:\\
\bxmenu{Merge Component Names}{}{}
\item A dialog will appear in which you can choose which of the selected names you want to merge all the names to. Select the name you want and click \bxcaption{OK}. 
\item The component names you selected will be merged to the name you specified throughout your test. 
\end{enumerate}
