\index{Delete!Component Names}

When you reassign component names in the \gdcompnamesview{}, you automatically create new component names if the name you enter did not previously exist in the \gdproject{}. 

Larger \gdprojects{} can often end up with a number of component names that are no longer used. You can see and delete these names in the \gdcompnamebrowser{}. 
The names in the \bxname{Unused Component Names} category  (\bxfigref{compnamebrowser}) are not used anywhere in this \gdproject{} -- they are not present in any \gdcases{} and they have not been mapped to any technical names from the \gdaut{} in the \gdomeditor{}.

To delete unused component names, select the name you want to delete and select:\\
\bxmenu{Delete}{}{}\\
from the context-menu.
