\bxtipp{The following section deals with entering component names in the \gdcompnamesview{} when you have added \gdcases{} from the library. For information on component names in \gdsteps{}, see the \gdsteps{} section \bxpref{specsteps}.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Once you have added a \gdcase{} from the library of \gdcases{} \bxpref{usingtemplate}, you will need to enter a component name for the component you want to test. 
\item In the \gdcompnamesview{}, you will see the \bxname{old name} for this component, which was given in the \gdstep{} contained in the library \gdcase{}. The old name is just a placeholder and should be \bxname{reassigned} (\bxfigref{compnamesview}).

\bxtipp{When you enter a component name in the \gdcompnamesview{}, you create a new reference to a component in the \gdaut{}. This component name appears in the \gdomeditor{} to be mapped to a component in your \gdaut{}. A \gdcase{} containing component names to be reassigned can therefore be used at a variety of different places to test different actual components. If you want to rename a component name, you can do so in the \gdcompnamebrowser{} \bxpref{TasksRenameCompName}.}

\item In the \bxname{new name} field, enter your name for this component, e.g. \bxshell{MainWindow\_NavigationTree\_tre}. 

We recommend using naming conventions for component names. 

\item Press \bxkey{Ctrl+SPACE} to see a list of component names you have already used for this type of component:

\begin{description}
\item[\bxname{Local}]{ component names are names you have used in this \gdcase{} for this component type. }
\gdmarpar{../../../share/PS/localName}{Local name}
\item [\bxname{Global}]{ component names are names you have used for this component type, but not in this \gdcase{}. }
\gdmarpar{../../../share/PS/globalName}{Global name}
%\item [Unused]{ component names are names that have already been mapped to this component type in the \gdaut{}. The \gdcase{} containing the component name has since been deleted.}
% \gdmarpar{../../../share/PS/OMLogName}{unused name}
 \end{description}

\bxtipp{You can configure how frequently the content assist in the \gdcompnamesview{} should open in the preferences \bxpref{}.}

\item The component name you enter here will be collected by the \gdomeditor{} when you carry out object mapping so that you can assign it to a component in the \gdaut{}. 

\item Every time you want to carry out an action on this component, use this name. 
\end{enumerate}
