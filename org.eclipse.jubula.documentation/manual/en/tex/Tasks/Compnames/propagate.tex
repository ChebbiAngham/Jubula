Select the checkbox on the left of the \gdcompnamesview{} to \bxname{propagate} this component name. This means that you will be able to see and edit (reassign) this component name when you reuse the parent of the \gdcase{} you are editing. 

This is useful for creating flexible keywords that can be used for the same workflow on different components. Depending on what you want the keyword to do when you reuse it, you can reassign the name to test different components in the \gdaut{}. 

For example, if you create a keyword \bxcaption{Replace and Check} which contains an action to replace a text and then check it. If you want to be able to use this keyword to enter and check text on any field in your \gdaut{}, then you should  propagate the component names from the actions by checking the checkbox in the \gdcompnamesview{}. Each time you reuse \bxcaption{Replace and Check}, then you will be able to enter a new name for the propagated component, allowing you to choose different names that can be mapped to different components.
