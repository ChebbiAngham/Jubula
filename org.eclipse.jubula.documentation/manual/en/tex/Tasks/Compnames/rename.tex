\index{Rename!Component Name}

Use the rename function to change the name of a component name in your test specification. Whereas \bxname{reassigning} component names results in a new component name being created \bxpref{TasksReassignCompName}, renaming just changes the name. 

You can rename component names in the \gdcompnamebrowser{}  and in the \gdomeditor{}. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Select the component name you want to rename. 
\item In the context-menu, select:\\
\bxmenu{Rename}{}{}
\item In the dialog that appears, enter a new component name to replace the old name. We recommend using naming conventions for component names \bxpref{BPComponentNames}. 
\item Press \bxcaption{OK}. The component name you entered will replace the old name throughout your test. 
\end{enumerate}

\bxtipp{You cannot rename a component name with a name that already exists. To merge two or more component names to the same name, see the section on merging \bxpref{TasksMergeCompName}.}
