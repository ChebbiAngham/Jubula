Categories let you  group items together to be able to keep an overview of your data and find things more easily. You can use categories in the \gdtestcasebrowser{}, in the \gdtestsuitebrowser{}, in the \gddataeditor{} and in the  \gdomeditor{} (see the section on object mapping for information on categories in the \gdomeditor{} \bxpref{TasksOMCategories}).
