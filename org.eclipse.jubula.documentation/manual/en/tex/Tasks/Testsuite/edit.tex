To configure a \gdsuite{}, you must first create one \bxpref{TSeditor}.

\bxtipp{If you are editing the \gdsuite{}, the working language (which is specified via the globe button on the toolbar) must be set to a language supported by the chosen \gdaut{} for the \gdsuite{}. Otherwise the \gdsuite{} will be uneditable. }

\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the \gdtestsuiteeditor{} by double-clicking on the \gdsuite{} you want to configure. 
\item In the \gdpropview{}, you can:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Change the \gdsuite{} name by entering a new name in the \bxname{\gdsuite{} name} field.  
\item Add a comment to the \gdsuite{} \bxpref{TasksEditorAddComment}. 
\item Enter a value in the \bxname{step delay} field. The step delay is the time left between each \gdstep{} during test execution. The default is 0 milliseconds \bxpref{TasksExecSpeed}.
\item Enter a Task ID to link this \gdsuite{} to a task in an external system \bxpref{TasksALMAddTask}.
\item Set whether this \gdsuite{} should be relevant or not. If a \gdsuite{} is marked as non-relevant, test results for ths \gdsuite{} are created but are not exported with the \gdproject{}, are not considered for any BIRT reports \bxpref{TasksBIRT} and do not save details to be reported to external ALM repositories \bxpref{TasksALMReport}. 
\item Select the \gdaut{} for this \gdsuite{}. To be able to select an \gdaut{} (and object map, and execute your test) you must have added at least one \gdaut{} to the \gdproject{} \bxpref{Defineaut}.
\bxtipp{You don't have to choose an \gdaut{} for a \gdsuite{} as soon as you have created it, but you will have to choose one before object mapping, for example.}

\item Choose a default reentry type for each of the four error types  from the combo-boxes. 

\gdehandlers{} are \gdcases{} used to deal with errors during test execution. When an error occurs, the current \gdcase{} is searched for an \gdehandler{} for that error type. If none is found, the parent \gdcase{} is searched, and so on. If no \gdehandler{} for the test is found, then a default \gdehandler{} (specified in the \gdsuite{} properties)is activated.  

As a general rule, you should avoid default \gdehandlers{} being executed.
See the sections on \gdehandlers{} for information on the event types \bxpref{eventtype}, reentry types \bxpref{reentrytype} and creating your own \gdehandlers{}.
\item Save the changes in the \gdtestsuiteeditor{}.
\end{enumerate}
