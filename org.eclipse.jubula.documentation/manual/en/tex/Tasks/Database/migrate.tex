If a new version of \jb{} uses a new \gddb{} scheme, you will be informed of this when attempting to connect to the \gddb{}.

From the information dialog, you can start the migration wizard. This wizard removes the old \gddb{} scheme (and any \gdprojects{} in it) and automatically creates the new scheme for the current version. 

You can choose which \gdprojects{} (exported from the old version) you want to import into the new \gddb{}.

If you do not have sufficient privileges to clear your \gddb{}, then you must manually clear it using a \gddb{} administration tool.
