\item \gd{} stores \gdprojects{} in a \gddb{}. Before you can access a \gdproject{}, you have to log in to the \gddb{}. 
\item The log-in dialog for the \gddb{} (\bxfigref{dblogin}) appears automatically the first time you need it (e.g. when you try to open or create a \gdproject{}).

\bxtipp{If you are using the default demo (embedded) \gddb{} installed with \gd{}, you will automatically be logged into the \gddb{}. If you did not configure a \gddb{} during installation, this means that you are using the default \gddb{}. }

\item Select the \gddb{} you want to use and enter your username and password for the \gddb{}.

\bxtipp{If you previously had another \gd{} version installed, you may see the information that your current \gddb{} version is not compatible with the latest version. If this is the case, then you can automatically migrate your \gddb{} \bxpref{DBMigrate}.}
