Testing is critical to the success of software projects. \bredex has been developing software since 1987, and has specialised in Java projects since 1995. Because the majority of our projects are designed for end users, we place particular importance on functional testing through the GUI.

When looking for a test tool, we had certain requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item  Automated tests should follow the same good practices and standards as software -- reusability, maintainability and structure.
\item Test creation should begin before an application under test is available, in contrast to capture-replay methods. The earlier you test, the easier and cheaper the issues are to resolve.
\item The effort for test creation and maintenance should be minimal.
\item Programming tasks should not be involved in test creation. Programmed tests are uneconomical because they increase the amount of code which has to be maintained by technical staff.
\item  Support for high-level operations on trees, tables, tabs etc.
\item Extensibility - to incorporate proprietary components into tests.
\end{itemize}
