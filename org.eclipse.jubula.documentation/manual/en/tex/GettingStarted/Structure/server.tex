\index{AUT Agent}
The \gdserver links the \gdaut to the \gdclient so that specified tests can be 
executed. 
It can be run on a remote or  local machine, and can even be installed on a
different operating system from the client, but it must be installed on the 
same machine as the \gdaut{}. 

A connection to the running \gdserver is established from within the client. 
This connection can then be used to start the \gdaut{}. 
Once the \gdaut is running, object mapping, observation and testing can take 
place.
