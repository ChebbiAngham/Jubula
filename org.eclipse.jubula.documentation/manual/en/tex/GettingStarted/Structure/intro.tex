As mentioned earlier, the \GD architecture consists of two elements: 
\begin{itemize}
\item a client part
\item and a server part (the \gdserver).
\end{itemize}
In the following we will use the name \GD or sometimes just
\bxname{client} to talk about the client application. 
To refer to the server part, we will 
use \gdserver{}.
