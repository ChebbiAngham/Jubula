The \gdclient is an \bxname{Eclipse} based application. As consequence you
need to set a writeable 
workspace directory on startup. Into this directory all preferences
will be saved. If you are
 using \gdclient as plug-in for \bxname{Eclipse} it will automatically use
 the eclipse workspace directory. 
But if you are using the standalone version of \gdclient you have to
tell the application which directory 
should be used as workspace. There are two ways to do this:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {You can set the workspace directly as a program parameter, when
  starting \gdclient. Therefore you 
have to create a shortcut or manually call the start executable with additional parameter.}
 % \begin{itemize}
 %   \item {''start.exe -data workspace'' (\bxname{Windows})}
 %
 %     This will create/use a directory named workspace inside of bxtp client directory.
 %    \item {''start -data ~/workspace'' (Unix)
%
%       This result into the usage of a workspace directory inside your home directory.}
 % \end{itemize}
\item {You can select a workspace directory through a dialog, that
  will automatically be displayed on 
client startup, when no workspace is set.}
\end{enumerate}
