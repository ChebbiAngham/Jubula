\item[Graphical User Interface]{
  A means of interacting with a computer by the use of a graphically oriented (as opposed to text-oriented) display. Modern graphical user interfaces (GUI's) are controlled by a mouse as well as a keyboard, and consist of windows, buttons, text areas, and other manipulable objects which are designed to make computer operation simpler and more intuitive.
