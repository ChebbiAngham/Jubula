In this tutorial, you will create the same test for the simple adder \gdaut{} as before. This time, however, you will not create the test using four \gdsteps{} in one \gdcase{}. Using a reused \gdproject{}, you will reference and adapt already existing \gdcases{} to save time with the test specification, and to make the test easy to maintain.
