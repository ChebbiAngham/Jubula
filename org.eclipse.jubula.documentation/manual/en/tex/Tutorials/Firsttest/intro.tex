In this example, you will create a simple test for a small Java program -- a calculator (the \bxname{simple adder}). 
The program will be tested by entering numbers into the fields, clicking the equals button 
and checking the answers that are produced. 

In this calculator, there is an error: the addition ofthe numbers \bxshell{17} and \bxshell{4} gives \bxcaption{jackpot} instead of \bxcaption{21}.
