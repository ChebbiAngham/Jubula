The \gdtestresultview{} shows you what happened in the test. \gdsteps{} that were successfully executed are marked with a green tick, and failed \gdsteps{} are marked with a red cross. 

You can single-click on any item in the \gdtestresultview{} to see details about it in the \gdpropview{}. 

You can also double click on any item to be taken to the place in the \gdtestcasebrowser{} in the execution perspective where this item is used. Another double-click here will take you to the same place, but in the specification perspective. 

You also have the option of right-clicking on a \gdcase{} in the \gdtestresultview{} and selecting \bxcaption{show specification}. This will take you to the specification perspective and highlight the originally specified \gdcase{}.
