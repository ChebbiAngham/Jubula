We mentioned in the last example that data entered at the \gdcase{} level can be overwritten when you reuse a \gdcase{}. 

\app{} lets you do this for all data which has not been entered as concrete values at the \gdstep{} level. Using references in the place of concrete values when you create \gdsteps{} makes them easier to reuse and adapt. 

The following example will use the test you just created to show how this works.
