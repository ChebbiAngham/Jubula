You can write tests for JavaFX \gdauts{} when you select the toolkit \bxname{concrete} or \bxname{JavaFX} in the \gdproject{} properties. The JavaFX and concrete toolkits actually contain the same actions as each other. 

When you select JavaFX as the \gdproject{} toolkit, the library \gdproject{} \bxname{unbound\_modules\_concrete} is automatically reused in your \gdproject{}. The actions in this library are described in the reference manual.
