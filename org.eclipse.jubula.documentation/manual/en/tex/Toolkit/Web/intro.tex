 HTML \gdauts{} are supported for testing. To be able to test HTML applications, select the \bxname{HTML} toolkit in the \gdproject{} properties. 

When you select HTML as the \gdproject{} toolkit, the library \gdprojects{} \bxname{unbound\_modules\_concrete} and \bxname{unbound\_modules\_html}  are automatically reused in your \gdproject{}. The actions in these libraries are described in the reference manual \bxextref{\gdrefman}{ref,actparam}.
