\index{ID attribute name}

Although \app{} does not require you to name components in your \gdaut{}, you neverthless make your \gdaut{} more testable by doing so.

\begin{itemize}
\item Each supported component in HTML \gdauts{} can have its own attribute used to identify it during test execution.
\item In your \gdaut{} configuration  \bxpref{autconfigbasic} , you can define an attribute name which should be used as an identifier for components. 
\item For example if your attribute name is \bxshell{testid} (e.g. \bxshell{<div testid=''Username''></div>}) then you would enter \bxname{testid} in the \gdaut{} configuration. 
\end{itemize}
