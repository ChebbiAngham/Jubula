\index{ID attribute name}

Although \app{} does not require you to name components in your \gdaut{}, you neverthless make your \gdaut{} more testable by doing so. In HTML \gdauts{}, you can enter a name for your components in the id tag.  You can also specify your own \bxname{ID attribute name} to be used as an identifier and enter this attribute name in the \gdaut{} configuration \bxpref{autconfigbasic} so that it is recognized as the component name for object recognition.
