You can write tests for Windows Store Apps \gdauts{} that are designed for the modernUI desktop when you select the toolkit \bxname{concrete}, \bxname{win} or \bxname{winapps} in the \gdproject{} properties. The win, winapps and concrete toolkits actually contain the same actions as each other. 

When you select \bxname{winapps} as the \gdproject{} toolkit, the library \gdproject{} \bxname{unbound\_modules\_concrete} is automatically reused in your \gdproject{}. The actions in this library are described in the reference manual \bxextref{\gdrefman}{ref,actparam}.
