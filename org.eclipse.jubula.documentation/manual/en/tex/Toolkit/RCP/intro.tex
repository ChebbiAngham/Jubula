You can write tests for RCP \gdauts{} by selecting the toolkit \bxname{concrete} or \bxname{RCP} from the \gdproject{} properties. If you will need to test RCP-specific components (such as toolbars with drop-down menus, or tree-tables), you will need to select \bxname{RCP} as the toolkit for the \gdproject{}. 
 
When you select RCP as the \gdproject{} toolkit, the library \gdprojects{} \bxname{unbound\_modules\_concrete}, \bxname{unbound\_modules\_swt} and \bxname{unbound\_modules\_rcp} are automatically reused in your \gdproject{}. The actions in these libraries are described in the reference manual.

\bxtipp{The GEF toolkit is a subset of the \bxname{RCP} toolkit and is described in a later section \bxpref{geftest}. }
