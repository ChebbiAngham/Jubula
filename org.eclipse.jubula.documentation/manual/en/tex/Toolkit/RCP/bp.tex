\textbf{Perspective layout reset}\\
One of the features of RCP \gdauts{} is that they generally remember the state of the \gdaut{} (position of views, which perspective was open) when the \gdaut{} is closed. In order to make tests as robust as possible, we recommend starting each use case with a module to reset the perspective to its defaults, and testing with this default perspective. 

\textbf{Workspace choice}\\
RCP \gdauts{} use a workspace to save user-specific preferences. The choice of workspace is usually offered before the \gdaut{} starts. This dialog is not currently testable by \app{}, so we recommend adding the desired workspace as an \gdaut{} argument in the \gdaut{} configuration \bxpref{configuringaut}. The parameter used to specify the workspace is \bxshell{-data ''WORKSPACE''}.
