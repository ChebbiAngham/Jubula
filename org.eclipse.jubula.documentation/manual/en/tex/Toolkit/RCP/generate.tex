\index{RCP!Generate Technical Names}

RCP \gdauts{} often use wizards and standard dialogs. The components in these dialogs are not often named by developers, and are in different places on Windows, Linux and Mac systems. 

\app{} lets you decide if unique names should be generated for these components in your \gdaut{}, if no name has been given. You can configure this in the \gdaut{} settings \bxpref{Defineaut}. We recommend selecting this option, as it makes your tests more robust to any changes and also makes platform-independent testing possible in RCP \gdauts{}.
