\index{Keyboard Layout}

For RCP \gdauts{}, a keyboard layout must be entered in the \gdaut{} configuration \bxpref{AdvancedAUTConfig}. German (DE) and English (US) are provided as standard keyboard layouts. 

If you require a different keyboard layout, you must create a mapping file for the new language and place it in the server/resources directory. You also have to put this mapping file into the RCP Remote Control plug-in of your \gdaut{}:\\


<RCPAUT>/plugins/org.eclipse.jubula.rc.rcp\_<Version>/resources
