Although \app{} supports identification and testing of GEF components out-of-the-box, it is highly recommend that application developers enhance this support by implementing an accessibility plug-in for their application. Such a plug-in makes identification of GEF components more robust and allows \app{} tests to reference additional components, such as connection anchors. The following sections explain how to develop an accessibility plug-in.
