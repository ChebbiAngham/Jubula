\index{GEF}
Like other tests, tests for GEF components are based on the component, action, parameter principle. However, it is important to note that individual figures are not addressed using component names. The only component that is mapped in GEF is the \bxname{figure canvas}.  The figures on the canvas are tested by referring to their textpath. See the Reference Manual for more details on the GEF actions. 

\bxtipp{The observation mode cannot be used to record actions in the canvas.}
