The GEF \gdinspector in the \ite{} allows you to collect information about the
textpath to an item from within your RCP \gdaut{}. For many of the actions on
GEF figures, you will need to know the textpath. Using the  accessibility
plug-in will mean that the textpaths will be easier to determine without the
inspector. See the extension manual for further information on creating your own
accessibility plug-in.

To use the inspector, you must have started the \gdaut{} \bxpref{startaut}. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the GEF \gdinspector{} if it is not already open via:\\
\bxmenu{Window}{Show View}{Other}
\item In the \gdinspector{}, select the \gdaut{} you want to inspect in from the drop-down menu next to the \bxname{activate inspector} button. 
\item Click on an item to inspect it.
\bxtipp{Make sure that the \gdaut{} is in focus before inspecting the figure. You may need to click in the title bar once to do this.}
\item In the GEF \gdinspector{}, the path to the item will be shown. If the code for your \gdaut{} uses the accessibility code, then the textpath will be less complex and more readable. 
\item You can copy the textpath from the \gdinspector{} via the context-menu and paste it as a parameter in your \gdcases{}. 
\bxtipp{You will need to activate the inspector for each item you want to inspect}
\end{enumerate}
