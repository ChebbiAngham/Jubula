\index{Editor}

There are four types of area in the user interface:
\bigskip

\textbf{Perspectives}

A perspective is a collection of views, editors and browsers on the screen. 

\textbf{Browsers}

Browsers let you see the \gdcases{} and \gdsuites{} you have created in their hierarchical structures. There is also a browser for component names. 

\textbf{Editors}

Editors let you modify, add and delete items. You can open editors by double-clicking on a node (e.g. \gdsuite{} or \gdcase{}) in a browser. 

\textbf{Views}

Views show details about the currently selected item. If you single-click an item in a browser, the details in the views are read-only. If you select an item from within an editor, you can edit some of the values in the views.  

\bigskip

You can change the way your user interface looks by moving areas, changing the colors, and hiding/showing views \bxpref{adapting views}. 

To reset the default layout at any time, select:\\
\bxmenu{Window}{Reset Perspective}{}.
