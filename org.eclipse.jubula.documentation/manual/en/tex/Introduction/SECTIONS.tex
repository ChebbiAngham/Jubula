\app{} is a tool for the automated testing of Graphical User Interfaces (GUI's) written with Java (Swing, SWT/RCP, GEF) and HTML. The focus of the tool is on testing an application's business logic (workflows, use cases)  from the user perspective (functional, black-box, acceptance testing).
 
\app{} is a keyword-driven tool. Tests are automated by dragging and dropping pre-defined modules (or \gdcases{}, or keywords) to make sequences of actions for your application. Each \app{} \gdproject{}  contains one or more libraries of these pre-defined modules for you to use. Test automation with these keywords is hierarchical -- using the libraries, you can create modules of your own and reuse them to make more complex tests and so on. 

Using the keyword-driven approach has various advantages, which are detailed in the next section \bxpref{JBApproach}.
