We have designed this tool to make testing easier and faster. However, it is a powerful application, and some of its features are quite sophisticated. We therefore recommend having a look at this manual. You can also access the manual from within the \ite{} by pressing \bxkey{F1}.  

In the reference manual, you will find information on more technical aspects, such as a description of the supported components and actions. The reference manual is also shown in the context-sensitive help when you press \bxkey{F1}.
