\jb{} has a well thought-out and intuitive user interface, and is designed to make testing easier and faster. However,  \jb{} is a powerful application, and some of its features are quite sophisticated. We therefore recommend having a look at this manual. You can also access the manual from within \jb{} by pressing \bxkey{F1}.  

In the reference manual, you will find information on the more technical aspects of working with \jb{}, such as a description of the supported components and actions. The reference manual is also shown in the context-sensitive help when you press \bxkey{F1}.
