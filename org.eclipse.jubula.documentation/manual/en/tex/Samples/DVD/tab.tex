This category contains four \gdcases{}. The first two, \bxname{Fill in the Content Tab} and \bxname{Fill in the Technics Tab} contain \gdcases{} reused from the \bxname{unbound\_modules\_concrete} \gdproject{} and the \bxname{bound\_modules\_samples} \gdproject{}. These \gdcases{} execute various actions on the tabbed panes in the DVD Tool. There is a lot of reuse of \gdcases{}, especially on different components. The \bxname{Enter a Text Detail} \gdcase{}, for example, is reused three times, with a different component name each time. The \bxname{Fill in the Technics Tab} \gdcase{} also contains an \gdehandler{} to check a checkbox if it isn't already done so. Many of the parameters in these \gdcases{} have been referenced so that values can be entered for them later. 

The last two \gdcases{} each contain a \gdcase{} to select a DVD, and then contain the \bxname{Fill in the Content Tab} and \bxname{Fill in the Technics Tab} \gdcases{}. Because the values in these \gdcases{} were left empty, different data can be entered for each \gdcase{}.
