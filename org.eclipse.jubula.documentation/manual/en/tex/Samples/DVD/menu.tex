This category and the ones following it contain \gdcases{} which are used in the executable \gdcase{} \bxname{2\_DVD\_TOOL\_FULL\_TEST} and the \gdsuite{} of the same name. 

The \gdcase{} in this category contains a reused \gdcase{} from the \bxname{bound\_modules\_samples} \gdproject{}. It contains \gdcases{} to add a category to the DVD Tool via the menu. The parameter for the category name has been referenced, as has a variable to read the category name entered for use later in the test. 

The original \gdcase{} in the  \bxname{bound\_modules\_samples} \gdproject{} had no data. When it was reused here, three data sets were added. This means that the \gdcase{} is executed three times, each time entering a different category name, and storing the name as a variable.
