This category contains a \gdcase{} which checks that a tree node exists, based on its textpath. Three data sets have been entered, which use the variables stored in the previous \gdcase{} to complete the textpath. 

For example, one of the stored variables was \bxname{CATEGORY1}. The textpath to test is entered as \verb+Category/${CATEGORY1}+.
