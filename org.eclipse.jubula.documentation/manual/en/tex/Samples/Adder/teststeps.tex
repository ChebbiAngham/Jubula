This category contains one \gdcase{}. The \gdcase{} contains four \gdsteps{}, which test an addition in the Simple Adder. The parameter values in the \gdsteps{} have been referenced, and a data set has been added. 

This is an example of a test written with \gdsteps{}. However, we recommend using the library of \gdcases{} to write tests, as shown in the next examples.
