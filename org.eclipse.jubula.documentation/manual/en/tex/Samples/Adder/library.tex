This category contains one \gdcase{}. The \gdcase{} has referenced another \gdcase{}, with four reused \gdcases, which have been reused from the \gdproject{} \bxname{unbound\_modules\_concrete}. 
\bxtipp{Press \bxkey{F6} to find where a particular \gdcase{} was originally specified. }

The \gdcases{} carry out the same steps as in the previous example \bxpref{samplesteststeps}. The differences here are:\\

\begin{itemize}
\item The steps to enter a value both reuse the same \gdcase{}, with different referenced parameters, and a different component name. 
\item The components used in the reused \gdcases{} are \bxname{abstract} components \bxpref{TasksCompNameType}. This means that the \gdcases{} are easier to reuse, making tests more robust and maintainable. 
\end{itemize}

This \gdcase{} is reused in the executable \gdcase{} \bxname{1.2\_SIMPLE\_ADDER\_TEST}, which is nested in the \gdsuite{} of the same name.
