The \gdproject{} contains a variety of \gdcases{} and \gdsuites{}. The \gdcases{} are grouped according to which \gdaut{} they test, and are also further grouped into categories corresponding to individual tests. 

\subsection{The reused \gdprojects{}}

The \gdproject{} \bxname{unbound\_modules\_concrete} is reused in this \gdproject{}. This \gdproject{} is a library of all supported actions in \app{}. 

The \gdproject{} \bxname{bound\_modules\_samples} is also reused. This contains \gdcases{} which are reused in the samples tests. 

\bxwarn{We do not recommend making any changes in these \gdprojects{}. }

\subsection{The categories}
\begin{description}
\item [Executable \gdcases:]{This category contains \gdcases{} which are ready to be executed. Each \gdcase{} corresponds to one \gdsuite{}, and is named accordingly. The executable \gdcase{} contains all the \gdcases{} necessary for a particular test, and includes all the data. }
\item [Tests with the Simple Adder:]{This category contains the \gdcases{} which test the Simple Adder program \bxpref{Samplesaddertests}.}
\item [Tests with the DVD Tool:]{This category contains the \gdcases{} which test the DVD Tool program \bxpref{Samplesdvdtests}.}
