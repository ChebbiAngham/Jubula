The meters application is a piece of software designed to manage meter readings for different flats in a building complex. The building complex is displayed on the left hand side in a tree, which contains nodes showing the flats and their meters. 

The most basic use case for this application is to take a meter reading. Taking a meter reading is also a part of the other two use cases shown in this example, moving a tenant in and moving a tenant out of the complex. 

This test uses central test data sets to manage its data \bxpref{TasksCentralData}. 

If you do not have write privileges in the \app{} installation directory, you must create a workspace directory for the meters application and enter this workspace in the \gdaut{} configuration for meters. In the \bxname{AUT Arguments} field, enter: \bxshell{-data <path to workspace>}.

%% \bxname{/examples/Samples.zip}\\
%% You will need to take the following steps to be able to run the meters tests:
%% \begin{enumerate}
%% \item Open the \app{} Workspace Perspective:\\
%% \bxmenu{Window}{Open Perspective}{\app{}Workspace}
%% \item Right-click in the \gdnavview{} and select:\\
%% \bxmenu{Import}{}{}\\
%% from the context-sensitive menu. 
%% \item In the dialog that appears, select \bxname{Existing Projects into Workspace} from the \bxname{General} category. 
%% \item Press \bxcaption{Next}.
%% \item In the next dialog, activate the \bxname{Select archive file} option.
%% \item Browse to the \app{} installation directory and then to the
%% \bxname{examples} directory. 
%% \item Select the \bxname{Samples.zip}. 
%% \item Click \bxcaption{Finish} in the dialog. The Excel files for the meters tests will appear in the \gdnavview{}. 
%% \item If you do not have write privileges in the \app{} installation directory, you must also create a workspace for the meters application and enter this workspace in the \gdaut{} configuration for meters. In the \bxname{AUT Arguments} field, enter: \bxshell{-data <path to workspace>}.
