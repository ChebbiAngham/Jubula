  <title>Creating ITE functions</title>
  <para>
    Functions represent program code that is evaluated during test
    execution. In order to define a new function, you will need to
    create an extension for the extension point
    <emphasis>org.eclipse.jubula.client.core.functions</emphasis>, which
    can be found in the bundle
    <emphasis>org.eclipse.jubula.client.core</emphasis>. This bundle
    also contains reference implementations of the extension point.
