  <title>Creating GEF toolkit extensions</title>
  <para>
    Although the identification and testing of GEF components is
    supported out-of-the-box, it is highly recommended that application
    developers enhance this support by implementing an accessibility
    plug-in for their application. Such a plug-in makes identification
    of GEF components more robust and allows tests to reference
    additional components, such as connection anchors.
  </para>
  <para>
    Apart from the general description for creating toolkit extensions
    in this manual, we give further information for extending
    the GEF toolkit. The following sections explain how to develop a GEF
    accessibility plug-in.
