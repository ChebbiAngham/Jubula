Users working with a PostgreSQL \gddb{} that is version 9.0 or higher should be aware that the default format from version 9.0 for bytea data types is \bxname{hex}. This results in screenshots in the \gddb{} not being able to be displayed. 

The default behavior can be changed to \bxname{escape} in \bxname{postgresql.conf} or by executing a command to set the default behavior on a per \gddb{} basis.
