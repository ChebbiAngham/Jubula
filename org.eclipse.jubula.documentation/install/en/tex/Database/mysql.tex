Users working with a MySQL \gddb{} may want to increase the maximum allowed packet size to avoid problems during the communication of large amounts of information (more than one MegaByte) between the \gdagent{} and the \ite{}.

To change the default packet value, you must:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Log into the MySQL command line client.
\item Enter the following into the console:\\
\bxshell{SET GLOBAL max\_allowed\_packet=33554432}\\
This sets a value of 32  MegaBytes (1048576 * 32 = 33554432).
\item Check that the value has been successfully set using:\\
\bxshell{SHOW VARIABLES}
\item Restart the \ite{} for the changes to take place.
\end{enumerate}
