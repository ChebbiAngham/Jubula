\begin{enumerate}
\item Before installing the new version of \app{}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perform an \bxname{export all} of your \gdprojects{} from your current database(s) with the current version of \app{} \bxpref{exportall}. This ensures that all projects (including the unbound modules and any other library projects you use) are backed up.
\item Export your database preferences from your workspace \bxpref{TasksPrefsImport}.
\item Back up any extensions you have written.
\item Delete the logs from your home directory (\app{} and the \gdagent{} must not be running for this to be performed)
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Standalone users}: Follow the instructions in the installation manual and the graphical installer to install the new version. We recommend installing each new version of \app{} in a new folder, whose name includes the version number. In this way, you can keep the older version until the migration is complete. 
\item \textbf{Plugin users}: Install the update into your current Eclipse. If you use tools from the standalone version in your environment (the \gdagent{}, for example), ensure that you update (install) these as well. 
\end{enumerate}
