If you have installed the \gdagent{} on other machines in the network in order to run distributed tests, then you will also need to update the \gdagent{} on those machines as well. You can install the \gdagent{} separately as an option during installation. Bear in mind that if you use scripts to start the \gdagent{} that contain the version number in them, these may also have to be updated. 

If you have the dashboard (\gd{} users only) in use, then you may have to update this as well. You can install the Dashboard separately as a part of the installation.
