\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the \gdproject{} you wish to update.
\item In the \gdproject{} properties, select \bxname{Used Projects}. You will see the old version of any used \gdprojects{} on the right hand side, and the new versions on the left hand side.
\item To perform a switch, select the new version and the old version of a \gdproject{}, and press the switch button with the two arrows pointing in different directions.
\item Press \bxcaption{OK}. 
\item In the new versions of the unbound modules, check the category \bxname{deprecated} for any modules that are marked as deprecated for this version number. You should find these modules (using e.g. \bxkey{F7} or \bxname{Show where used}) or any \gdsteps{} in your \gdproject{} and replace them with the newer version. Where possible, the new module will be referenced in the deprecated modules. Otherwise, search in the relevant category of the unbound modules to find the newer version. 
\item Once the switch has been performed for all unbound modules in all \gdprojects{}, then you can delete the old versions of the unbound modules from the \gddb{}. 
\end{enumerate}
