As the \ite{} is an Eclipse application, it can be configured just like any other Eclipse application can -- including setups for multi users. 

You should speak to your administrator about the setup you require. If multiple users should have access to e.g. extensions, then we recommend using a shared configuration area. 

Further information on different configurations for Eclipse applications can be found at:
