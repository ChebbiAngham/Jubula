\subsection{Supported operating systems}
The following operating systems are supported by \app{}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Microsoft Windows (tested on XP, Vista and Windows 7)
  \item  Linux (tested on fedora 11 and centos 5 with GTK)
  \item Mac OSX (not for SWT \gdauts{})% (tested with Cocoa) 

\end{itemize}

Although the software may run on other systems, we cannot guarantee that \app{} will run properly on them; nor can we support an installation on such systems.

\subsection{Supported \bxname{Java} environments}
\begin{description}
\item [\app{} client component (Integrated Test Environment, \ite{}):]{JRE version 1.5 minimum}
%\item [\app{} client (Eclipse plugin):]{JRE version 1.5 minimum}
\item [\app{} server component (\gdagent):]{JRE version 1.4 minimum}
\item [\gdaut{}:]{JRE version 1.4 minimum}
\end{description}
Java 1.6 is provided in the \app{} installation.  

For the \ite{}, you will need a 32-bit Java version. The operating system you use can be 32 or 64 bit, however. 

\subsection{\gdDB requirements}
\app{} supports  \bxname{Oracle 9-10} as a multi-user \gddb{}. There is an embedded \gddb{} which is installed with \app{}, but we only recommend using this for demo purposes. 

Other databases may work, as supported by \bxname{Eclipse Link}, but we can offer neither guarantee of their proper use nor technical support. 

\subsection{Firewalls and \app{}}
\app{} has to be able to perform interprocess communication in order to run tests. No information is sent to external sources during this process. 

The ports required by \app{} are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item From the \ite{} to the \gdagent{}: this port is defined in the \app{}  preferences.
\item From the \gdaut{} to the \ite{}: this port is dynamically chosen, and cannot currently be defined. Therefore, any ports available on your test machine must also be open on the machine from which the test is being run.
\end{enumerate}

 If opening all ports in this way is not an option, we recommend using the \app{} test executor on the test machine to run the tests, so that all communication is done locally. 


\subsection{Supported Eclipse versions}
Eclipse RCP \gdauts{} must be based on version 3.1 or higher of Eclipse to be tested with \app{}.
