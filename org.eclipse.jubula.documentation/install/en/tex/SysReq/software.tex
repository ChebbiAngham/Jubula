\subsection{Supported operating systems}
The following operating systems are supported:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Microsoft Windows (tested on Windows 7 and 8), 32- and 64-bit
  \item  Linux (tested on Centos with GTK), 32- and 64-bit
  \item Mac OSX (not for SWT \gdauts{}), 64-bit 

\end{itemize}

Although the software may run on other systems, we cannot guarantee that the components will run properly on them; nor can we support an installation on such systems.

\subsection{Supported \bxname{Java} environments}
\begin{description}
\item [Installer:]{Java 7}
\item [Client component (Integrated Test Environment, \ite{}):]{Java 7 minimum}
\item [Server component (\gdagent):]{Java 7 minimum}
\item [\gdaut{}:]{Java 1.5 minimum}
\end{description}
Java 7 is provided in the  installation for Linux and Windows.

 

\subsection{\gdDB requirements}
The \ite{} supports  \bxname{Oracle} as a multi-user \gddb{}. There is an embedded \gddb{} which is installed as well, but we only recommend using this for demo purposes. 

Other databases may work, as supported by \bxname{Eclipse Link}, but we can offer neither guarantee of their proper use nor technical support. 

\subsection{Firewalls}
The \ite{} and \gdagent{} have to be able to perform interprocess communication in order to run tests. No information is sent to external sources during this process. 

The ports required are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item From the \ite{} to the \gdagent{}: this port is defined in the  preferences.
\item From the \gdaut{} to the \ite{}: this port is dynamically chosen, and cannot currently be defined. Therefore, any ports available on your test machine must also be open on the machine from which the test is being run.
\end{enumerate}

 If opening all ports in this way is not an option, we recommend using the test executor on the test machine to run the tests, so that all communication is done locally.
