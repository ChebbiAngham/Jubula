There is a known problem with an environment variable which is installed with certain products, including other test tools, and may not be uninstalled when these products are uninstalled. 

The variable is called ''\_JAVA\_OPTION'' and causes problems for the \ite{} and possibly also for other Java-based software.

To see if this variable is installed on your computer, locate your list of environment variables.

If the ''\_JAVA\_OPTION'' variable is present, and you have uninstalled the program which used it, then you can simply remove the variable.
