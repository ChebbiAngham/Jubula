Choose which component(s) to install: 

\begin{description}
\item [The Integrated Test Environment (\ite{}): ]{This is where test are created. Tests can also be executed from the client. You can think of this as the main application. The \ite{} can also run headless -- the test executor.}
\item [The \gdagent{}:]{ This component is responsible for controlling the \gdaut{} during test execution. It must be installed on the machine(s) where you want your \gdaut{} and tests to run. It requires a network connection to communicate with the \ite{}. }
\end{description}

	\item the \ite{} and test executor
	\end{itemize}
\item \gdagent{}, this bundle includes only the \gdagent{}, which handles the testing of your \gdaut{}.
\item \app{} Documentation, this bundle includes the PDF Documentation.
\end{itemize}
