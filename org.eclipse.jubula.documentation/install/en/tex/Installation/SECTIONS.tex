We have a graphical installer to make installation as straightforward as possible. 

You don't need administrative privileges to install the components, but the folder where the software will be installed must be writable and allow program execution.

See the following sections for information on installing on Windows and Unix systems. For installation on  other platforms, please follow the Unix installation procedure, and adapt the instructions as necessary.
