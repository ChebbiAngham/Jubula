  <title>Configuring as an Eclipse application for shared environments</title>
  <para>
    As the ITE is an Eclipse application, it can be configured just like
    any other Eclipse application can â€“ including setups for multi
    users.
  </para>
  <para>
    If multiple users should have access to e.g. extensions, then we
    recommend using a shared configuration area.

  <emphasis role="warning">
  	If you are working with Jubula for multiple projects that use different
  	AUTs, once you have written an extension for a specific AUT, you should 
  	ensure that you are using your own installation of the ITE for this AUT. 
  	This is to avoid problems with multiple extensions for different AUTs in one
  	ITE.
