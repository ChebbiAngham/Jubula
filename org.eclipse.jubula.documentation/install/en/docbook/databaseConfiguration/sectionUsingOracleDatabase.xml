  <title>Using an Oracle database</title>
  <para>
    The ITE is tested with Oracle and we recommend using an Oracle or
    Oracle Express database for working with it.

    <title>Some tips for working with Oracle Express</title>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">Problems creating the database scheme: DBA rights</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      There is a known issue with Oracle Express when creating
      database schemes with DBA-rights. In some cases, the creation of
      the database scheme may fail. To avoid this problem, do not use
      DBA-rights when creating the database scheme.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">Increasing sessions and processes</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      Oracle Express uses a relatively small amount of sessions.
      Insufficient sessions can lead to problems when working with the
      ITE. To combat this problem, the sessions and processes in
      Oracle Express should be set higher.
    </para>
    <para>
      We recommend 100 as a suitable amount. The sql script to do this
      looks like this:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
sqlpls / nolog
connect / as sysdba
alter system set sessions=100 scope=spfile;
alter system set processes=100 scope=spfile;
quit
</programlisting>
    <para>
      You must run the script as an administrator and restart the
      database once the script has run.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">UTF-16 support</emphasis><?linebreak?>
      If you want to test AUTs which run in languages such as Japanese, you will need the universal
      edition of Oracle Ex- press, which supports UTF-16 character encoding. The ISO- 8859 edition of
      Oracle Express does not support Japanese (and similar) characters.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">User roles</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      When creating users for the database, bear in mind that each
      user must have the roles <emphasis>connect</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>resource</emphasis> to be able to work with the
      database.
