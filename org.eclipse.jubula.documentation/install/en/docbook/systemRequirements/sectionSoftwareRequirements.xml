      we support an installation on such systems.

      The ITE supports <emphasis>Oracle</emphasis> as a multi-user

      well, but we only recommend using this for demo purposes.

      Other databases may work, as supported by <emphasis>Eclipse

      The ITE and AUT Agent have to be able to perform interprocess
      communication in order to run tests. No information is sent to
      external sources during this process.
    </para>
    <para>
      The ports required are:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          From the ITE to the AUT Agent: this port is defined in the
          preferences.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          From the AUT to the ITE: this port is dynamically chosen,
          and cannot currently be defined. Therefore, any ports
          available on your test machine must also be open on the
          machine from which the test is being run.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
      If opening all ports in this way is not an option, we recommend
      using the test executor on the test machine to run the tests, so
      that all communication is done locally.
